Starting yesterday we have three weddings to attend within the span of a month. My parents will celebrate 42 years of marriage within this time span, too! One of these weddings is between two youth in our church, and this is a VICTORY to be celebrated. There have been no weddings of local members held in our church since Afonso was a child. Our denomination has strict rules about who is allowed a church wedding – nobody who is pregnant or who is known to have been involved in a prior pregnancy is granted the right to a church wedding. All the marriages that have been formed in the past 10 or more years have not complied with the church’s standard. And then we decided to have our church wedding in Canada and so didn’t get to break the trend in person. So next weekend we’ll celebrate a broken trend – YAY! There are three other church weddings in process for the end of the year, Lord Willing.\n<!--more-->\nBecause of this trend, one of the ministries we’ve been involved in is a small group of young couples who began married life with a baby on the way and had no pre-marital counseling in the church. Recently that group seems to have “fizzled”. It seems that the members were not willing to be open about some of the real issues they face as couples. We have been hearing about difficult circumstances in their marriages, and the group should have been a safe place to pray about those issues and learn together. We’ve been praying – how might the Lord want to use us in the lives of these couples? Do we need to try and resurrect the group or do we need a new “method”? There is so little sense of “US” in most of the marriages we see. How can we be catalysts to a more healthy cooperation?\n\nWith my adolescent girls, we’ve spent the past few months praying for the future husband of each girl. We’ve prayed about the temptations they face, their fear of God, their money &amp;work, their physical, emotional &amp; spiritual health, their view of money &amp; their work ethic, and other issues. The girls have been sewing satin jewelry bags that I hope will serve as a reminder to them to pray and wait for a man prepared by God to be a worthy husband. I keep reminding the girls that these jewelry bags need to go on their honeymoon with them. They’re in process of composing prayers for their future husbands that they’ll seal in an envelope to open on their honeymoon as well. Pray with me as I prepare and deliver our next series of studies about fetal development and abortion. I want to deal with the issue clearly and sensitively. Abortion is illegal in Angola but there’s a law on the books proposing its legality, and abortion is widely available. In street language, abortion is referred to as, “taking away your belly\", which shows that Biblical teaching is necessary!\n\nHaving babies is definitely a fad in Angola. It seems I’m often out looking for good baby gifts for friends. We’d like to get in on the baby trend – please pray for the Lord’s timing and our contentment with His plans for our next baby.\n\nWe have three funerals in our church family this weekend. The one we’re most involved in is the funeral of a baby that was born with a strange defect – her bones don’t seem to have been connected. She was the second born child of a young couple that recently transferred to our church from across town. Suridia was about 5 months old. Her father has recently been hospitalized and is still not well, but we’re thankful that he is at least able to be present.\n\nThe month of July looks like it will be particularly challenging for us as a family. Afonso is required to complete a cross-cultural internship and will be away for the better part of July. Together with one of his classmates, he’ll be serving in an area where there is no cell phone coverage or email access. The language/culture group in that area is primarily Mwuakavona. Yva and I depend a lot on Daddy, so please start praying already for us as we prepare for the separation. Please also pray for God’s work to be done in and through Afonso during his internship. There are still some details to be worked out in terms of transportation, and the guys will have to take their own food, being that there was very little harvest in that part of the country this year. Lots of preparation – pray about all the details!\n\nAfonso’s semester of school is coming nearer to the end. He keeps lamenting that he’s not feeling very motivated about his assignments and would appreciate your prayers that he could be diligent. After this, there’s just one semester to go, and Lord willing he’ll be finished his Bachelor of Theology in December!\n\nOur current thought for our time in Canada is to travel next July. We’ll spend the summer in Toronto and the with family in the Stony Plain area, then the idea is to move to Three Hills for Afonso to spend a semester studying English at Prairie. During the fall we’ll spend most of our Sundays out at the Bergen church, and make some other weekend visits to family, friends, supporters and churches in Alberta. If we are able to renew Afonso’s visitor visa, we will stay into 2014 to have more time to travel and visit. Home Assignment comes with LOTS of logistics, so pray that over the coming year those details will begin to fall into place.\n\nYva keeps amazing us with her thirst for learning. Thanks to a DVD my mom sent us, Yva can already distinguish 8 different shapes – unbelievable! She has figured out that she knows two languages, and often will use English and Portuguese words interchangeably. An example of this is that she calls me “Mamá, Mommy, Mamá, Mommy,” and Afonso gets, “Daddy, Papá, Daddy, Papá.” Of course, she won’t be two until late September, so she’s not speaking full sentences (except in her own babble) but we’re pretty amazed at her ability to communicate. She had her first bout of malaria a couple of weeks ago, but rallied quickly and doesn’t seem worse for the wear. We are thankful that she’s been so healthy and able to concentrate on development instead of survival.\n\nWe could report on many other aspects of life and ministry, but I think you have enough prayer fuel to keep you going for a while! We are conscious of the fact that we are able to live and work in Angola thanks to YOU. Your prayer and gracious giving are God’s provision of daily bread for us. Be blessed as you bless us and others,\nBecky, for Afonso &amp; Yva too!\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\nSIM Angola','ABY’s Ewaves May 2012','','publish','open','open','','abys-ewaves-may-2012-2','','','2013-08-04 20:59:58','2013-08-04 20:59:58','',0,'http://www.mlplace.ca/chinhama/abys-ewaves-may-2012-2/',0,'post','',0),(17,3,'2013-08-04 21:29:56','0000-00-00 00:00:00','There were many moments of despair and lots of sleepless nights as we waited for Afonso\'s visitor visa to come through, but WE ARE IN CANADA, and we made it on time for our Thiessen family reunion.','Back in Canada','','draft','open','open','','','','','2013-08-04 21:29:56','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.mlplace.ca/chinhama/?p=17',0,'post','',0),(19,2,'2013-08-11 20:08:59','2013-08-11 20:08:59','<h2>ABY’s Ewaves August 2013</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca.s3.amazonaws.com/aby/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/DSC02366.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-47 alignleft\" alt=\"Swift- DSC02366.JPG\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca.s3.amazonaws.com/aby/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/DSC02366-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></h2>\nDad sent this unanswered question to us by email about 6 weeks ago, “Why is it that God allowed the Israelites to get backed up to the Red Sea with an army behind them before he opened the way?” Our departure from Angola was similar in some ways! On July 15<sup>th</sup> we FINALLY received word from the Canadian consulate in South Africa that Afonso’s passport was ready to be picked up. We think that Mom’s call to her MP’s office probably helped Afonso’s visa to get approved more quickly than it would have otherwise been issued in the work-to-rule environment of the Canadian consulate. As soon as we could, we arranged for the courier to pick it up. . .but the courier had technical issues and couldn’t give us a tracking number or confirm for us whether it had indeed been picked up. We were left with a decision – should we book our plane tickets to leave Angola on the 21<sup>st</sup>, or wait until we actually had the passport in hand? Finally on the 19<sup>th</sup> the courier had its technical issues sorted and we learned that Afonso’s passport was scheduled to arrive on Saturday the 20<sup>th</sup>. Within minutes, <!--more-->we’d emailed our travel agent and asked for tickets out of Windhoek, Namibia on Monday the 22<sup>nd</sup>. All that was left to organize were the tickets to Windhoek for Sunday morning. Many trips to the ticket office and airport later, we kept getting the same answer – that the flight was totally booked but we could show up on Sunday morning and would probably get spots. So on Sunday morning we were at the airport in hopes that we wouldn’t have to rush home to get the car and begin the 16 hour drive to Windhoek. JUST before check-in closed, our tickets were finally issued, and we RUSHED through security and made it into the plane just in time for them to close the doors. A pastor friend who was on the same flight said, “God must have something special for you in this trip, because there seems to be some opposition to you traveling.”  Five flights and three days later we were at Mom and Dad’s near Stony Plain, Alberta. WHEW!\n\nWe had 2 days to catch up with ourselves before heading to our Thiessen family reunion. In spite of still being jet lagged, it was SO good to be there to see everyone, including cousins I hadn’t seen in 17 years. We were blessed that Grandpa and Grandma made it there for a good part of Saturday, as well. All in all, it was too short and just plain GOOD.\n\nNow another few weeks have flown past as we enjoy summer activities like shelling and blanching peas, wiener roasts and picnics, mowing the lawn, and endless hours of trampoline, playhouse, slides and swings for Yva and her cousins. Nearly every day we spend some time SHOPPING, too. We’re trying to get set up for Fall, and do at least the bulk of our shopping for things to take back to Angola already this summer because we’ll be much busier in the Fall.\n\nFall is coming quickly and is panning out more or less as follows:\n\nAugust 28-Sept 12 – Toronto, Ontario to finalize Afonso’s membership and orientation with SIM, as well as visit friends and supporters\n\nSept 14/15 – move to Three Hills, AB, where we have lined up a basement suite to live, and are already accumulating borrowed furniture\n\nSept 16<sup>th</sup> – Dec 20 - Afonso attends individual English classes with David Nadeau in Three Hills, and we spend our weekends visiting friends, supporters and family. At this point we can’t see an opening for traveling beyond the borders of Alberta, as much as we would LOVE to get to friends and family there. Our time is just too short, it seems!\n\nDec 21 – Jan 1<sup>st</sup>  – back to Stony Plain for family Christmas/New Years celebrations\n\nJan 2<sup>nd</sup> – begin our journey back to Angola. This date could get bumped later if dates change for the wedding we’re “hosting” in Angola\n\nPraise the Lord with us:\n<ul>\n	<li>that we’re HERE in Canada and made it on time for the Thiessen reunion</li>\n	<li>for the provision of a camping trailer to live in over the summer, a suite to rent for the Fall, and offers of furniture and dishes, and even a cell phone to use</li>\n	<li>for time with family over the summer</li>\n	<li>for Yva’s easy adaptation to Canada</li>\n	<li>Our prayer requests for the coming months:</li>\n	<li>That the Lord will clearly lead as we make decisions with SIM regarding our next term</li>\n	<li>That we’ll get re-organized technologically – we lost our address records and recent photos in our March theft, and need to get our contact lists together as well as multi-media presentations and better ways of communicating with you, like including photos in our updates – what a novel idea!</li>\n	<li>for opportunities to share about our ministry with churches and individuals</li>\n	<li>That the Lord will provide financially for us as a family – our support account is low and we need additional funding to reach family support levels as opposed to the “single” support we’ve been receiving (neither Afonso nor Yva were contemplated in our previous support requirements)</li>\n	<li>God’s provision, too, for the building project we have with our home church in Angola.

(Google Dictionary)\n\nWhy we are like turtles:\n<ol>\n	<li>Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? The moral of the story is, “Slow and steady wins the race”. In our ministry in Angola of teaching, mentoring and discipling, we are making long term investments in people’s lives. We rarely see quick results, like a hare hurriedly hopping across the finish line. Sometimes it’s “just” another Bible class, “just” another hour listening, asking questions, and praying together, sometimes it’s “just” another visit to someone’s home when they’re going through a rough patch. One small step after another – “the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed” in the people to whom we’re ministering. (Gal. 4:19)</li>\n	<li>The scaly or leathery shell is a turtle’s home, which he carries with him for shelter at any time or place. Missionary life means that we need to make our home wherever we happen to be. We currently call five different places “home”: we have rented a basement suite in Three Hills, AB, where I also studied and worked over a period of 8 years; my parents and siblings all live near Stony Plain, AB; I grew up in the rural community of Bergen, AB; Afonso has lived in Lubango, Angola most of his life, that’s where I’ve lived and worked over the past 11 years, where we met, and where most of our earthly belongings reside; and HEAVEN will be our eternal home.

If you’ve seen us since then, you already know who the green guy is. If you haven’t seen us or are new from Facebook to this list, WELCOME! You are all welcome to check out our still-under-development blog at Chinhama.mlplace.ca to learn more!\n\nIf I wait just one more day to write an update, we might have more clarity about our next term in Angola, more exciting news to let you in on, a better developed blog, a new way to generate our emails   . . . and so the days fly past. This is how I procrastinate!<!--more-->\n\nNovember has been a bit of a whirlwind! We were blessed through our visits to three different churches this month, as well as a number of small groups. If we had kept track of the odometer readings in our car, we could impress you with how far we’ve gone, but we weren’t organized enough to keep track! And mileage is all immaterial now because . . .at the beginning of the month we were rear-ended in our 2002 Toyota Camry! We will surrender it to the insurance company this weekend. For this whole month we’ve continued to drive it with Tuck-Tape taillights and a tied down trunk. We are thankful for a number of offers of vehicles to borrow for our final weeks, and plan to use a pick-up truck that my brother’s brother-in-law had planned to take off the road for the winter. We are thankful that the insurance pay-out will allow us pay back the loan to our friends!\n\nAfonso’s English studies have been going well! Everyone who has seen him has been impressed by his improvement. However, he will be glad when he can put away his grammar books.\n\nWe’ll sure miss preschool! The fall term will end next week, and we’ll have to endure of “Mommy, when I wake up tomorrow, will I go to school?” Yva has really enjoyed preschool, and I’ve enjoyed a few hours a week of more concentrated time. Our little 3 year old is a sponge for learning, and can participate quite well in our newest car game of thinking of English words that start with a particular letter of the alphabet. In fact, I get left in the dust by Afonso and Yva, and I’ve been speaking English a lot longer than the two of them put together!\n\nHardly a day goes by that someone doesn’t ask us what we think of winter. Afonso is polite and says, “It’s good.” My response is always, “It’s only OK because we get to escape part way through.” Our tickets back to Angola are booked for January 1<sup>st</sup>, which will put us back into Lubango on January 5<sup>th</sup>.\n\nWhat’s next? There are still lots of details to work out, but here are some of the ideas that in discussion for the coming term:\n\n-We are committed to a young couple, Victor &amp; Aida, as padrinhos (closest I can get is godparents) for their January 18<sup>th</sup> wedding. This will take a blog entry to explain. Check Chinhama.mlplace.ca for this SOON!\n\n-SIM’s partner church, the UIEA, is in process of organizing a discipleship program to use across the denomination. A friend of ours, one of the younger pastors in the denomination, is heading it up. We’ll be working with him in its development and implementation across the country. This will likely take us to Ethiopia for an internship, learning how their well-developed discipleship ethos is implemented, and gleaning ideas for development of a similar initiative in Angola.\n\n-the UIEA has a Bible Institute (basic level) in Menongue, about a 6 hour drive from our home in Lubango. We have been asked to do some teaching there, and even to move to Menongue. Pray for wise decision making about this option. We’re keen on teaching there, but to be honest, not so keen on living there!\n\nOur travel dates are set, and little by little we’re getting a clearer picture of our next term in Angola. Are we ready? We’re certainly feeling the tug of war – longing for one home while dreading good-byes with the other. Little by little we’ve collected suitcases to fill (British Airways allows us 3 per person!) and all kinds of things to fill them with. The part that’s the least clear to us is our financial readiness. We started our Home Assignment with close to an additional $2000 per month to raise. If we go by what we’ve actually received in writing, we still have $1690 to go. That doesn’t look very promising, nor is it accurate, so we’re trying not to panic :-/  We’re thankful for some one-time gifts that have helped with our deficit. We’ve also been encouraged by a number of verbal affirmations of financial support which haven’t been specified or confirmed with SIM Canada. We can only GUESS that we still have about $1200 left to go. Please pray with us about this! We are excited about moving forward in what God is leading us into, but can’t get very far if we’re not fully supported. Please let us know if you have further questions about our finances, or if you’d like to join our prayer or support team.\n\nOnline stuff:\n<ol>\n	<li>Please remember to check out our under construction blog at Chinhama.mlplace.ca.

We find ourselves back on the African continent, with many stories to tell and much to be thankful for. On December 20<sup>th</sup> we moved out of our basement suite in Three Hills, and up to Stony Plain for our family Christmas and final packing. Minus the packing, it was a wonderful time! We played and visited, and celebrated Christ’s birth with our family. We even got in on the Thiessen Family Christmas/New Years get together with fireworks at Uncle Weldon’s – a rare treat! Packing was stressful as usual, but we managed to get all our stuff equally distributed between the 9 suitcases that British Airways allowed us, without going overweight. <a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_0756.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_0756\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_0756-1024x1024.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"604\" /></a>\n\nBritish Airways ALMOST didn’t let me board the plane on January 1<sup>st</sup>! Their computer says that a Canadian passport must be valid for 6 months beyond a traveller’s stay in Namibia. Our flights with BA were booked only as far as Windhoek, Nambia, and my passport expires in March. Finally they allowed us to complete our check-in, allowing us time for a quick final meal with Mom, Dad and Lori at the Calgary airport before flying. Phew!   Our travels went smoothly from that point on. The immigration authorities in Namibia didn’t even raise an eyebrow at my nearly expired passport. The next challenge-turned-blessing was that only 3 of our suitcases arrived in Windhoek with us. When we flew on to Lubango 2 days later, the suitcases still hadn’t appeared, and so British Airways was obligated to fly the suitcases on to us in Lubango when they arrived in Windhoek a few days later. If they had all arrived on time, we would have had to leave them in Windhoek waiting for car rides, as the Angolan Airline only allows one suitcase per person. This way we received ALL our baggage directly in Lubango much quicker than we would have otherwise, and at no extra cost to us! God is good!\n\nYva’s only response to friends and family on the first day was “Ya.” She seemed a bit confused by switching back to a Portuguese speaking environment, but within a couple of days was chattering away with no complications. We haven’t been able to visit all her friends yet, but she’s had fun with some children visiting in the guest house upstairs, some of whom are also bilingual.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our Toyota hasn’t adapted quite so well to being back in use! We had to get a new battery, which wasn’t too big of a surprise. Our surprise came the next day, when the car started randomly shutting down, and the day after, when the smell of smoke accompanied the shut-down. Afonso was close to our local mechanic’s shop, so it was a short tow. The mechanic called in an electrician friend of his, and they pulled the dashboard and front end apart. I don’t understand all the details, but a LOT of wires and a panel had to be replaced. There are some electronics that are still not working, and there are other issues that need attention so the car is back at the shop. We borrowed it back over the weekend for the wedding, and along with a borrowed Jeep that only runs in 2<sup>nd</sup> gear, we managed to get everywhere we needed to over the busy wedding weekend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_0021.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-127\" alt=\"IMG_0021\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_0021-1024x764.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"450\" /></a></p>\nWeddings in Angola go on for nearly a week. Last Wednesday, the groom’s family went to the bride’s home to officially pick her up. She came to us about midday. On Thursday morning, a civil ceremony was held at the local conservatory. We were back to church rehearsals that afternoon. Friday was a full day with getting last minute details organized with the families, and our final rehearsal at the church. Friday night we had the 7 bridesmaids overnight as well as the bride. The girls were up about 5am to start getting ready, but even so, we were late for the 3pm wedding! Our delays came from slow hair-dos, having to buy flowers last minute and make up a bouquet, since the flowers that had been arranged for didn’t show up. . .and one of the bridesmaids getting burned with hot oil while cooking lunch. . . Never a dull moment! Afonso didn’t eat either breakfast or lunch on Saturday, and he and I got to bed at 5am and 4am, respectively. Overall, things went well, but we are still not totally recovered! The bride and groom are expected to be in church on Sunday morning, and then the wedding party continues on Sunday afternoon. On Monday, the groom’s family was back at the bride’s home to pick up her “trousseau” in order for her to cook them all lunch, so the newlywed’s chance to rest is delayed until TUESDAY after marrying on Saturday. The bride and groom are now safely housed in a little house we’ve rented for them for the week, until they go back to Luanda this coming weekend. We have the privilege of continuing on as mentors for this new couple.\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSC_0433.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0433\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSC_0433-1024x680.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"401\" /></a> Of course, this wedding is part of ministry – we are committed to discipleship and mentoring in Angola! From here on, we’re on a learning curve as we get involved in developing a discipleship program for our denomination here in Angola. Pray for us during this time of transition, especially since Afonso is a DO-er, and likes to clearly know what is expected of him. Unfortunately, it’s going to take a while before expectations are clear and routines are settled. We are planning a few months of experience and learning in Ethiopia, which COULD happen as soon as March if everything comes together quickly, so keep praying for us as decisions are made.\n\nOver the coming weeks we are also planning to do some research about schooling options for Yva. She is only three, but we need to explore preschool options in order to decide whether she starts already this year, or only next, depending on our travel plans and the programs available! We also need to decide whether she goes to an English or Portuguese school, and different schools have different calendars (Feb-Nov or Sept-June). So many things to consider!\n\nThanks so much to all of you for partnering with us in this adventure!','January News','','publish','open','closed','','january-news','','','2014-01-28 03:35:16','2014-01-28 10:35:16','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=126',0,'post','',0),(127,3,'2014-01-28 02:58:43','2014-01-28 09:58:43','','IMG_0021','','inherit','open','closed','','img_0021','','','2014-01-28 02:58:43','2014-01-28 09:58:43','',126,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_0021.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(128,3,'2014-01-28 03:00:28','2014-01-28 10:00:28','','IMG_0756','','inherit','open','closed','','img_0756','','','2014-01-28 03:00:28','2014-01-28 10:00:28','',126,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_0756.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(129,3,'2014-01-28 03:09:18','2014-01-28 10:09:18','','DSC_0434','','inherit','open','closed','','dsc_0434','','','2014-01-28 03:09:18','2014-01-28 10:09:18','',0,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSC_0434.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(130,3,'2014-01-28 03:16:26','2014-01-28 10:16:26','','DSC_0433','','inherit','open','closed','','dsc_0433','','','2014-01-28 03:16:26','2014-01-28 10:16:26','',126,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSC_0433.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(145,3,'2014-03-10 07:37:56','2014-03-10 13:37:56','Disclaimer: we’ve had almost no internet for the past month. .. . so no photos this time, sorry – and this is at least 3 weeks old already!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n“For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.” 1 Cor 13:12\n\nA good friend of mine recently said that ambiguity is one of the most draining things we face. She had first-hand knowledge of ambiguity since she was waiting to get her passport back from Angolan immigration so that she could travel. In our weekly prayer times with ex-pat ladies, the two of us that are currently around are also facing some ambiguous plans.\n\nMost of you didn’t hear the whole story of our departure from Canada. We ALMOST weren’t allowed to board the plane because my passport expires in March. I was supposed to renew it while we were in Canada, but forgot until it was late enough to run the risk of not having my passport back before our planned departure. Oooops! Now it is contributing to some ambiguity! Until I get my new passport, we can’t travel to Ethiopia, or anywhere else outside of Angola. We are hoping that it’s a quick – my application should be in process at the Canadian consulate in Zimbabwe. On top of that, we are still waiting to hear from Ethiopia what the best timing will be from their end. Keep praying with us!\n\nSome ambiguity has diminished about our new role in the realm of discipleship in Angola. This past weekend a retreat was held by the newly established department of discipleship for national and regional leadership of the UIEA denomination. It was exciting to hear about what is beginning to happen in our denomination – a recognition that relationships are the key to transforming our country. Angola has what could be classified as big problems, but we were encouraged to THINK BIG, START SMALL and GROW DEEP with people who are FAT (Faithful, Available and Teachable). Our role will be to work alongside the coordinator of the department of discipleship, helping with training, teaching, and supervision of the discipleship movement across Angola. In a sense we will be helping to train and provide accountability to pastors and leaders who will be training and mentoring other disciple-makers. At the same time, we will continue to be involved in discipleship on a local level.\n\nSince we can’t dig into anything too deeply before knowing when we’ll go to Ethiopia, each day begins with a bit of ambiguity. Yva and I are the easiest to keep busy. Cooking, cleaning, shopping and laundry, along with keeping Yva occupied can easily become a full time job; and I STILL can’t keep up! I’m also “dabbling” at teaching a few music lessons and writing a lesson for our denomination’s Sunday School curriculum, and reconnecting with girls I’ve mentored over the years. Thanks for praying (please continue!) that Afonso would find meaningful work for each day. His main source of occupation lately has been keeping an eye on a renovation project, and helping with the electrical end of it. Our experience is that work gets done much more efficiently if an “owner” is watching.\n\nOur vehicle is back on the road, PTL! We have most of the kinks worked out from our fried electrics. We will need to do some fairly major maintenance sometime soon, but the timing of that will depend on our Ethiopia plans.\n\nWhile we wait for plans to solidify, pray that we\'ll use our time and energy wisely!

In some ways, I feel like we’ve continued our Home Assignment here in Angola, albeit unplanned. The feeling comes not from being on the road reporting about our ministry, but the fact that we’re not really BACK into busy scheduled ministry. Only the Lord knew that we wouldn’t be off to Ethiopia right away upon our return to Africa. Since WE didn’t know, we held back on reintegrating into ministries here, thinking we’d be leaving any day. We still have no word from the church in Ethiopia regarding the timing of our visit there.\nWhat does life on stand-by look like? Lots of travelling!\nSince we didn’t have any major commitments, we decided it was time we took our vehicle to Namibia for some upgrades. We hadn’t even been able to find the right size of tires here in Lubango! We are thoroughly enjoying our new offroad suspension and new tires. Well, we’d enjoy them more if our car hadn’t been back in the shop for gear box issues! I guess our 2005 Toyota Prado isn’t a new vehicle anymore so we shouldn’t be too shocked. We spent about two weeks in Windhoek, and were able to get dentist check-ups done, and Afonso got new glasses, too.\nThe other major thing we were able to do in Namibia was to begin the process of sorting out Yva’s Angolan registration. When she was born in Windhoek back in 2010, the Angolan embassy did not process her documents in line with her original birth document from the Namibian authorities. I won’t go into details, but we are VERY thankful that they were willing to re-issue correct documents this time around. Afonso has since made two trips to Luanda to follow through with the rest of the process. This very necessary paperwork has taken a lot of Afonso’s time and energy. We will be very glad when Yva has her new Angolan birth certificate and passport.\nA few days after returning from Namibia, Afonso was off north and east to the city of Luena. . .by bus and TRAIN – a total of close to 48 travel hours round trip. Leaders from the churches in two provinces met for two days of training regarding discipleship. Afonso sensed excitement about this new initiative among the majority of them, but knows that the reality of implementation of ANY new idea is an uphill road. Pray that these pastors will implement the more relational model of mentoring and teaching that they have been taught.\nSince Afonso has been back and forth to Luanda, Yva and I made one road trip without him. Cavango is a historic mission station that was completely destroyed during the civil war. We have SIM colleagues living there now. Visitors from the States came to discuss some rebuilding, and visiting doctors from the UK wanted to help out with some rural clinic work in the area, so we had four restful days visiting while they worked, with a 9 hour day of travel on each end.\nCloser to home, Afonso has been preaching fairly regularly in our church, as well as a daughter congregation about 7 km out of town. I’ve been challenged by the fresh perspective he has brought to a few of the passages he’s preached from. At the same daughter church, Afonso has started a discipleship group with leaders from that and a second daughter congregation. He has been amazed (or appalled!?) at how few of them spend time in the word of God and in prayer on their own. On the other hand, I was encouraged by Afonso’s account of one of the men who shared, in their discussion about the meaning of salvation, that he pictures salvation as having been imprisoned for his whole lifetime and then suddenly set free. Over the years I’ve heard so many Angolans speak of salvation in terms of turning from bad behavior to good behavior, so I found this brother’s description very inspiring.\nSince mid April, Yva is a student again. We enrolled her in a preschool program designed for young children to learn English, but which is a broad enough program for Yva as purely preschool. Classes are Monday – Friday, 8am – 10am. She enjoys school, and I enjoy the routine that it brings at home.\nAngola is in the midst of a national census, however, so all educational institutions nation wide are closed for the whole month of May. Many teachers and university students are were given incentive to participate in the census process – hence the hiatus. Yva’s classes were only suspended for the actual 2 scheduled weeks of the census, but we have heard rumours that the census process is slower than planned and may be extended. We want classes to start again!\nAs for me, beyond the full time job of keeping the house running, I’ve been trying to get to some reading and analyzing of discipleship materials, and have finally gotten around to this update! There are many other things I’d love to tell you about, so I MUST write more often rather than extend this update any further.\n','May we?','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2014-05-23 11:05:14','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=148',0,'post','',0),(151,3,'2014-05-23 12:03:23','2014-05-23 18:03:23','According to SIM’s regulations, we could have been allowed 12 months Home Assignment in Canada, but because of immigration restrictions in both Angola and Canada, we had less than 6 months outside of Angola.

We spent about two weeks in Windhoek, and were able to get dentist check-ups done, and Afonso got new glasses, too.\n\nThe other major thing we were able to do in Namibia was to begin the process of sorting out Yva’s Angolan registration. When she was born in Windhoek back in 2010, the Angolan embassy did not process her documents in line with her original birth document from the Namibian authorities. I won’t go into details, but we are VERY thankful that they were willing to re-issue correct documents this time around. Afonso has since made two trips to Luanda to follow through with the rest of the process. This very necessary paperwork has taken a lot of Afonso’s time and energy. We will be very glad when Yva has her new Angolan birth certificate and passport.\nA few days after returning from Namibia, Afonso was off north and east to the city of Luena. . .by bus and TRAIN – a total of close to 48 travel hours round trip. Leaders from the churches in two provinces met for two days of training regarding discipleship. Afonso sensed excitement about this new initiative among the majority of them, but knows that the reality of implementation of ANY new idea is an uphill road. Pray that these pastors will implement the more relational model of mentoring and teaching that they have been taught.\nSince Afonso has been back and forth to Luanda, Yva and I made one road trip without him. Cavango is a historic mission station that was completely destroyed during the civil war. We have SIM colleagues living there now. Visitors from the States came to discuss some rebuilding, and visiting doctors from the UK wanted to help out with some rural clinic work in the area, so we had four restful days visiting while they worked, with a 9 hour day of travel on each end.\n(Please forgive the crooked photos, my computer is performing very poorly and I don\'t want to wait to post!)\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_afonso.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-157 size-large\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_afonso-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_afonso\" width=\"604\" height=\"805\" /></a>\nCloser to home, Afonso has been preaching fairly regularly in our church, as well as a daughter congregation about 7 km out of town. I’ve been challenged by the fresh perspective he has brought to a few of the passages he’s preached from. At the same daughter church, Afonso has started a discipleship group with leaders from that and a second daughter congregation. He has been amazed (or appalled!?) at how few of them spend time in the word of God and in prayer on their own. On the other hand, I was encouraged by Afonso’s account of one of the men who shared, in their discussion about the meaning of salvation, that he pictures salvation as having been imprisoned for his whole lifetime and then suddenly set free. Over the years I’ve heard so many Angolans speak of salvation in terms of turning from bad behavior to good behavior, so I found this brother’s description very inspiring.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"604\"]<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_yva.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-158\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_yva-858x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Yva\'s 1st day of school\" width=\"604\" height=\"720\" /></a> Yva\'s 1st day of school[/caption]\n\nSince mid April, Yva is a student again. We enrolled her in a preschool program designed for young children to learn English, but which is a broad enough program for Yva as purely preschool. Classes are Monday – Friday, 8am – 10am. She enjoys school, and I enjoy the routine that it brings at home.\n\nAngola is in the midst of a national census, however, so all educational institutions nation wide are closed for the whole month of May. Many teachers and university students are were given incentive to participate in the census process – hence the hiatus. Yva’s classes were only suspended for the actual 2 scheduled weeks of the census, but we have heard rumors that the census process is slower than planned and may be extended. We want classes to start again!\n\nAs for me, beyond the full time job of keeping the house running, I’ve been trying to get to some reading and analyzing of discipleship materials, and have finally gotten around to this update!

Maybe if I try for a while to write short, focused updates each Tuesday, I won’t get overwhelmed by how much there is to say, and then start procrastinating (who me?). Tuesday starts with the same letter as Turtle, so that will be my memory jogger. Hold me to it!\n\nFires of Forgetfulness\nSomething we haven’t told many about are the two fires we’ve had in our house this year. We’re not proud of them, ‘cause they were both caused by PURE forgetfulness.\nThe first fire started when we fell asleep with a candle burning a few months back. The Lord woke us up minutes before we were asphyxiated in our bed. Afonso had supernatural strength to BLOW out the flames that were already being fueled by melted Vaseline and the wooden shelf. There was a lot of soot to clean up the next day, and for many weeks following. The photo is the shelf AFTER most of the mess was cleaned up.\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fire1-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-169\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fire1-2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Fire1-2\" width=\"604\" height=\"805\" /></a>\nThe second fire was last week. I made a few French fries to add to our supper – and forgot to turn off the burner under the hot oil. Our kitchen and dining room are separated by a hallway, so there was a lot of smoke and flame before we noticed. It was actually the SOUND that alerted me to something abnormal going on. Again – LOTS of smoke and soot to clean up. I’m hoping that repeated scrubbing will get my blackened pot back to a useable state! We need to find some smoke detectors, don’t we?!\n<a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/muirlake/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/kitchen-fire.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-170\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/muirlake/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/kitchen-fire-764x1024.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen-fire\" width=\"604\" height=\"809\" /></a>\nI wonder what other kinds of damage gets done around me because of my distracted forgetfulness? I get caught up in routine: cooking, cleaning, laundry, and the grocery budget and somehow forget bigger things. Not that I shouldn’t do the daily tasks, but I don’t want to get so distracted by them that fires like bad attitudes or trust-less-ness have time to pollute my heart and mind. Getting a task done sometimes consumes me while Yva tugs at my elbow; will fires of resentment start in her heart? What about fires burning in our churches, like materialism and deep-rooted witchcraft, which need to be confronted with transformational discipleship? Making disciples, after all, is the task that we’ve been given!\nLord, don’t let us get asphyxiated in the distracted sleep of forgetfulness!\nSomething else next Turtle Tuesday!\nBecky\nFor Afonso, Becky and Yva Chinhama\nServing with SIM in Angola','Turtle Tuesdays','','publish','open','closed','','turtle-tuesdays','','','2014-07-30 07:19:05','2014-07-30 13:19:05','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=163',0,'post','',0),(169,2,'2014-07-30 07:57:19','2014-07-30 13:57:19','','Fire1-2','','inherit','open','closed','','fire1-2','','','2014-07-30 07:57:19','2014-07-30 13:57:19','',163,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fire1-2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(175,3,'2014-08-05 14:37:24','2014-08-05 20:37:24','(Turtle Tuesday 05 August 2014)\n\n<strong>Catota</strong> – Is one of the historic mission stations founded by missionaries in the early 1900’s. These missions gave birth to independent churches which later were joined together to form what we now know as the UIEA – the Union of Evangelical Churches of Angola. The UIEA is the principal denomination with whom we partner in Angola. Except for the church, all the buildings at Catota were destroyed during Angola’s civil war. The provincial government has now rebuilt a small hospital with staff housing, and a school.\n<strong>Centennial Celebration</strong> - The first mission was in founded in Muié in 1914 – which means that this is our centennial year! A BIG celebration took place at Catota from July 2-6. Afonso spent nearly 2 weeks on one of the advance teams, getting the Catota mission ready to receive the crowds.\n<strong>Crowds</strong> – The official count of participants in the closing ceremony of the Catota Centennial Celebration was. . . .17,000 people.  We were a mere three among MANY. Close to 70 from our local church made the trip to participate, about 600km by the most direct route, but about 900km by the route passable by bus.\n<strong>Camping</strong> – Imagine camping with that many people! Although many of the 17,000 came only for Sunday, we must have been over 10,000 camped in the bush surrounding Catota. Each congregation organized logistics for meals, and river water was distributed by the local fire department for cooking. Some well water was available at the school and hospital sites. Lots of latrines were prepared. Most campers bathed in the river.\n<strong>Conference</strong> – We had 2 days to wash clothes, prepare more grain/gluten free snacks, and re-pack after Catota. Then we were off to our 5 day annual missionary conference at Tchincombe ranch. We were camped again, but this time with running water much closer, and meals prepared in a kitchen instead of only over an open fire. We were blessed by fellowship, good Bible teaching from Dr. Ted Rendall, children’s program from a team of (mostly) Three Hills folks, fun, and good food.\n<strong>Cold</strong> – July is the coldest time of the year. Nights can get down around freezing or even below in some areas. In spite of being cold, it is MUCH more practical to hold big events in July than anywhere between October and April when the rains wash roads away (and make everyone WET). Despite the cold nights, we still got pretty hot during the daytime, especially at Tchincombe.\n<strong>Coughs and Colds</strong> – I went to Catota with a cold, got mostly over it, then along with Yva and a large group, caught a terrible cough and cold at conference. Others had fever and flu symptoms as well as the cough. It’s been three weeks and I still coughed a bit this morning. Afonso caught it later and didn’t get it QUITE so bad.\n<strong>Catching up</strong> – isn’t it great that you’re holding me accountable to write each Tuesday so I can get you caught up on all the things going on in our lives and ministry?\n<strong>disClaimer</strong>: PHOTOS – we are counting on getting great photos from a friend, and will post them soon.\nBecky, for Afonso, Becky &amp; Yva CCCCCCC<strong>Chinhama</strong>\nSIM Angola','CCCCCCCCCCC','','publish','open','closed','','ccccccccccc','','','2014-08-05 14:37:24','2014-08-05 20:37:24','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=175',0,'post','',0),(179,3,'2014-08-14 13:59:40','2014-08-14 19:59:40','','IMG_2011','','inherit','open','closed','','img_2011','','','2014-08-14 13:59:40','2014-08-14 19:59:40','',181,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_2011.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(180,3,'2014-08-14 14:02:09','2014-08-14 20:02:09','','DSCN0804','','inherit','open','closed','','dscn0804','','','2014-08-14 14:02:09','2014-08-14 20:02:09','',181,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSCN0804.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(181,3,'2014-08-14 14:53:08','2014-08-14 20:53:08','\n(Turtle Tuesday August 12th - or Thursday!)\n\nBack in 1987, our church (Mitcha) planted a daughter church out of town, 7 km down the road, where there is a small village called Rio Nangombe (Cow River, or Cattle Creek) surrounding a train station. The church has functioned with lay leaders during this whole time, with occasional visits from the mother church for teaching and administration of communion.\n\nFive years ago when I got to know the congregation, the 7 km to Rio Nangombe were quite an undertaking, as the road was nearly impassable, especially in the rainy season. Over the past couple if years, the railway and road works have advanced greatly, the city has mushroomed, and the church is on our back doorstep. Most of its members are still rural folk who live off the land, and the older folks are mostly illiterate. Umbundu is the language of preference for many. Things keep changing quickly, however, as a huge market is being built right next to the church property. One of the big markets from the city will be relocated there, with its corresponding population, trash and crime.\n\nOn June 15th, baptisms were held in the creek below the church. Three from the Nangombe congregation and eleven from Chela, the preaching point further down the road, were baptized. These folks have publicly identified themselves with Christ\'s deal, burial and resurrection, we pray that they\'ll abide IN CHRIST, grow, and bear fruit.\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_2011.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_2011-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2011\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-179\" /></a>\n\nThe national discipleship movement we\'re involved in has the strategy of discipling church leaders and preparing them to be disciplers of others. So rather than a direct involvement in the lives of the newly baptized, Afonso has started a study group with the leadership of the Nangombe and Chela congregations. (I\'m not very helpful due the Umbundu factor). It\'s a bit of an uphill battle; here\'s a recent conversation Afonso had with the few who showed up for their last study, which incidentally had COMMITMENT as its theme:\n\nAfonso: If you send a child to do a task and they don\'t do it, what do you call them? \nGroup: (quick answer) Disobedient. \nAfonso: I gave you an assignment and only one of you took time to study during the week. What is that called? (Long pause) Well, what would you call that? Isn\'t it the same thing? \nGroup: (sheepish throat clearing)\n\nThese are the people we count on to disciple others! Let\'s pray for growth- this is likely a sample of \"average\" among our church members.\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSCN0804.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSCN0804-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"DSCN0804\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-180\" /></a>\n\nNote: If you\'re reading this in an email, you may be interested to know that it\'s actually a blog post from chinhama.mlplace.ca.

We have stretched the study out over the course of a full year, although it\'s a fifteen chapter book, since most participants are high school and university students who also work or have heavy family responsibilities. I\'ve also noticed that reading speed and comprehension are fairly low in general. There are currently 3 young women enrolled, and I\'ve just \"taken over\" the class again, to finish out the waning year while the other teacher takes a sort of \"paternity leave\". \n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/str-portuguese-front-020007.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/str-portuguese-front-020007.jpg\" alt=\"str-portuguese-front-020007\" width=\"84\" height=\"139\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-186\" /></a>\n\nThe study focuses on the \"main thing\" of the Bible, giving an overview of the why and how of salvation. We chose this study as a follow-up to catechism classes, starting with those who were teaching Sunday School and Children\'s Bible Club. We\'re disappointed at the waning interest in the course - that there are many new teachers who have not been required to participate in this \"Continuing Education\".\n\nOnce students have completed \"The Stranger\", they\'re encouraged to enroll in Theological Education by Extension courses which we re-activated in our church nearly 4 years ago. These are 10-week self-study books with weekly meetings for clarification of doubts. Twenty-seven books make up the whole series, which are associated with the local interdenominational Bible College as the equivalent of the first year of a Bachelor of Theology degree. The idea was to complete 3 books per year, but strict schedule-keeping has waned, being that the teacher who took over the orientation of these courses is busy as a school principal, 4th year theology student, and father of a large household. He and some of the students have been bugging me to return as course moderator, and I just learned that he\'s rarely present at the weekly meetings, but leaves the few remaining students to discuss amongst themselves.\n\nAs a family we appreciate your prayers for wisdom - we want to be involved in our local church and its daughter congregations in relevant ways that will have long term fruit in the Kingdom of God, without burning out, and without allowing our responsibilities on the NATIONAL level to wane (helping to develop materials and train regarding discipleship).\n\nWe are un-waningly (is that a word?) thankful for YOU who are reading this post and un-waningly supporting us in so many ways,\nBecky\nfor Afonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama, SIM Angola\n(Subscription additions/changes available at chinhama.mlplace.ca)','Waning !?','','publish','open','closed','','waning','','','2014-08-19 15:11:09','2014-08-19 21:11:09','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=184',0,'post','',0),(186,3,'2014-08-19 14:50:49','2014-08-19 20:50:49','','str-portuguese-front-020007','','inherit','open','closed','','str-portuguese-front-020007','','','2014-08-19 14:50:49','2014-08-19 20:50:49','',184,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/str-portuguese-front-020007.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(190,3,'2014-08-28 09:11:42','2014-08-28 15:11:42','Heart, Soul, Strength\nI love watching the way Afonso grabs hold of a project with all his might.

Yva has a toy doctor kit but also uses pens and pencils and scraps of napkins to apply alcohol and give injections on a regular basis.\n\nA Songwriter\nMy Dad says I used to converse with him in song. Yesterday, even while crying/whining, Yva put a wobbly melody to her complaint about not wanting to finish her lunch. Besides in conversation with me, we hear songs full of random thoughts about life, God, friends and toys.\n\nA four year old\nWe often get comments about how tall Yva is for a three year old. Our little girl will be 4 at the end of this month, and now that we\'re into September, BIRTHDAY is a big focus.

As a family we don\'t go all the time, one reason being that it\'s tricky to make grain and dairy free pizza. Last Friday we were there, and even stayed till late, \'cause we were waiting for our newest SIM colleagues to arrive. Danny, April, Riley and McKenna Hall have just joined us and since Friday we\'re helping them find their way around and get set up.

Well, Sam calls chicken a vegetable! They\'re planning a 5 year stint in Gabon while Sam completes a surgical residency.

Our building project and other preparation for hosting the National Assembly is coming along! I told Afonso the other day that you know you\'re a leader when you turn around and find people following you. There are a quite a few young men in the church who have been working alongside Afonso these past few weeks, and informal mentoring goes on as they work. I love it!\n\n(photo is supposed to be here, but internet is still only cooperative enough to post the text today)\n\nAfonso\'s busyness has allowed me to take some of the more formal teaching opportunities that he was invited to do. For me the most significant event was an afternoon discussing \"The Challenges Facing Youth Today\". I took advantage of Sean Marston\'s experience and research (www.youthmesh.org) and made a list of statements I thought the youth might make. I had them work in groups to categorize the statements as either urgent, relevant or non-issues, then rank the urgency of the ones they all agreed were urgent. Result? Top ranking issue was this: \"I want to follow Jesus and the Bible, but sometimes I\'m disappointed by the institution called church\". This was not a surprise to me after having having read Sean\'s articles and worked with these youth over the years. Then we talked about constructive steps they can take to change the picture, as well as a handful of recommendations they\'d make to \"church\". Second biggest urgency? \"I want to know the Bible better\". Pray for this group; pray for us as we invest in them from ladders and lecterns; and for the church in Angola and around the world as we strive to keep \"church\" relevant.\n\nNote: the word I wrote as \"church\" is my way of designating the institution of church, not a means of belittling The Church, which is the body of Christ.\nOther note: \"youth\" in our context are 16-30 year olds, not the junior high variety :)\n\nsent from chinhama.mlplace.ca on behalf of Afonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama, SIM Angola','Ladders and Lecterns','','publish','open','closed','','ladders-and-lecterns','','','2014-09-24 07:17:25','2014-09-24 13:17:25','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=207',0,'post','',0),(213,3,'2014-10-10 11:41:34','2014-10-10 17:41:34','Turtle (Tues)day October 10, 2014\n\nIt\'s a turtle day. I\'m really off schedule, but have FOURish quick things to say today. Hopefully things will settle into routine again next week.\n\nFOUR (1): Yva had a birthday! Our little girl is already FOUR! We had about 35 kids here in the yard for a butterfly themed party. It was slightly chaotic! Yva loves parties but because of allergy restrictions we don\'t often let her go to parties. We hope she got her fill for the next while, and that we can do smaller parties as she gets bigger! Afonso thought he took pictures, but alas, they\'re not on the camera. \n\nFOUR (2): The day after the big party, FOUR ladies loaded up and headed out on a little get-away to Namibia, Monday to Monday, 8 days. We spend the better part of FOUR days on the road, so we didn\'t get much relaxing done! However, good food we didn\'t have to cook, conversations about everything and nothing, a change of scenery, and stocking up on specialty foods we can\'t get in Lubango, all contributed to a great get-away. This was made possible by Afonso\'s loving and sacrificial solo-parenting, and the help of family and friends, especially our good friends Marijn and Noortje. I took only three photos on the whole trip, none of which are all that significant.. . \n\nFOUR (3): The first of FOUR expected new (Angola) cousins for Yva was born yesterday. \'Tis the season, apparently! It will be fun to watch them all grow up together. Keep praying with us that the Lord will grow our family too, seasons like this are bitter-sweet for us.\n\nFOUR (4): In approximately FOUR months we\'ll be headed to Ethiopia FINALLY for some training about discipleship. We\'ll fill you in on more details as time goes on. The training is all the more necessary now. . .because Afonso learned today that the Executive Committee of our denomination has appointed him as the national coordinator for Evangelism and Discipleship(shhhh, it hasn\'t been announced yet!). We \"signed on\" to support and work alongside that coordinator in the area of discipleship, but he has stepped aside. Pray for us as we navigate deeper responsibilities than we expected. \n\nFOUR(teen): This the week of assembly meetings at our church, and Afonso is working FOURteen hour days keeping things running as smoothly as possible for the approximately 200 delegates. He\'s TIRED and this is my week for solo parenting!\n\nSent from chinhama.mlplace.ca for Afonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama, serving with SIM Angola','FOUR','','publish','open','closed','','four','','','2014-10-10 11:41:34','2014-10-10 17:41:34','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=213',0,'post','',0),(217,3,'2014-10-29 03:30:21','2014-10-29 09:30:21','Turtle Tuesday 28 October 2014\n\nI came across an OLD supermarket receipt a while back. Eleven years old! I didn\'t remember that our shops even HAD computers back then! I remember shopping around town to find the items, often making five stops to get the necessary items, sometimes getting nothing from my list. It may have been that way on the particular day I shopped back in 2003, since there were only four items on the list. I made a rough estimate of today\'s prices to compare, and found that in the past 11 years, prices have as much as DOUBLED what they were. The bonus is that there\'s almost NOTHING I can\'t find!\nThis got me thinking. The inflation increase is about equal to the percentage increase in our monthly support needs when Afonso joined SIM a year ago. By the end of our last term I was falling behind the approximately $2,500 monthly requirement, and now as a family our needs are approximately $4,500 per month. Almost DOUBLED. What took 11 years to increase by inflation in Angola is the same support increase we were obliged by immigration restrictions to raise in only 6 months of Home Assignment. We\'ve been so blessed by the MANY new financial supporters (individuals and congregations) who have strengthened our turtle legs (see our post from Oct 2013), even after those 6 months were up. Your generosity has averaged about $3,500 per month, a significant increase, PTL!  Since we still receive the agreed allowance amounts, we\'re creating a growing support deficit which at the end of September and a lot of re-working was mysteriously and miraculously only at $1,918. In addition, we recently realized that we still have a deficit in our Home Assignment travel account, amounting to $5,100 (or maybe only $3,600, we\'re still sorting some details out with SIM Canada). \nYikes! We certainly were taken aback by these numbers. We\'ve also been nervous and been rewriting this post for at least a month as we\'ve tried to sort out the details. But you know what? NOTHING surprises The Lord! Over and over we\'ve seen HIM surprise US when we have specific financial tight spots in our monthly budget. We lack for NOTHING. We believe that we are doing what He has called us to. We believe that it\'s fair for you to be aware so that you can pray with us for His provision. We believe that you deserve a chance to give if God calls you to do so. We are asking the Lord for one time gifts to cover our travel deficit ($5,100.00) and support deficit ($1,900), and for committed monthly givers to cover our continuing need of the remaining approximately $1000 monthly.\n\"For nothing will be impossible with God\" Luke 1:37\n\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\nSIM Angola\ngenerated from chinhama.mlplace.ca, where subscription options are also available\nOnline giving available at www.sim.ca\n','Doubled and Nothing','','publish','open','closed','','doubled-and-nothing','','','2014-10-29 03:30:21','2014-10-29 09:30:21','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=217',0,'post','',0),(221,3,'2014-11-05 06:28:59','2014-11-05 13:28:59','Turtle Tuesday 04 Nov 2014\n\nTurn today\'s date around, and what do you get? 04 becomes 4-0.

I can’t keep it short today – many random things to share:\n\nYva says that Christmas is about Santa Claus, Oh, Jesus. She is anxious for Christmas to come, and we’re hoping that we can make it special enough to compete with the only Christmas she can remember, which was last year in Canada. She may be disappointed that there’s no snow and no big family gift opening. Most importantly I hope we can keep it Jesus focused. We just started listening to Christmas music as I sat down to write. Yva is looking forward to participating in the Sunday School program on December 14th.  We do have a few small gifts on their way with a visitor from Canada and something big and VERY special waiting in the garage for Yva. For now we\'re enjoying the lights in town!\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23751.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23751-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2375[1]\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-230\" /></a>\n\nNovember 11th was Independence Day in Angola, and we spent the day with a group from our church in a marriage retreat. Our retired pastor, Pastor Sikila, led us in teaching and discussion about money management. I was struck again by the fact that many Angolan couples keep their finances separately and make decisions individually. Pray for more “us” thinking in marriages.\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23621.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23621-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2362[1]\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-227\" /></a>\n\nFor those who remember “Grace” from our presentations in Canada, please pray for her. She texted the other day to say she’s been feeling discouraged lately, but has been so busy that she hasn’t had time to come pray with me. \n\nWe haven’t been in the best of health recently. Yva and I have both had pretty bad colds, and I had ANOTHER bout of giardia, which has been an all too common occurrence. The giardia treatment was dreadful as usual. Back in Canada, my Mom had surgery to insert a stent into a restricted ureter, which has given her many bouts of kidney-stone-like pain over the past few years.\n\nWhile Mom was in the hospital, her mom, Mary Thiessen, passed away. She was 88 and had a full life. Grandma’s memory has now been restored after a downhill road with Alzheimer’s, she is pain free and full of pure joy in the presence of HIM who loves her infinitely more than the MANY she left behind. We were hugely blessed by being able to watch her funeral live on FaceTime. The tributes given pointed out Grandma’s many Godly attributes. Pray especially for Grandpa Jake who has been by her side for nearly 70 years.\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_9844-copy.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_9844-copy-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9844 copy\" width=\"604\" height=\"402\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-229\" /></a>\n\nTwo new discipleship groups have been started. One has been in my heart for months. Many youth girls in our church are Sunday School and kid’s Bible Club teachers, but don’t have a place to grow. Only a handful have participated so far, and I won’t pressure them too much to participate – I want only the FAT (Flexible, Available &amp; Teachable) girls to participate.\n\nAfonso feels the same way about his new group. Fifteen young people were baptized 10 days ago and have been “handed over” to Afonso to form a growth group. A good number showed up for the first meeting – pray that they’ll hunger for more.\n\nMany other things also vie for our attention, so I think our main request for this week is that we’ll find time for a team meeting between Afonso and I. We need to make some decisions about our assigned ministry of coordinating the discipleship initiative for our denomination. Once we find/make time for this, we’ll need wisdom for the decisions. While we’re in our team meeting, we may take some time for a parenting pow-wow too, another area that requires a daily dose of many character qualities we sometimes run low on.\n\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\nServing with SIM in Angola\nemail version sent from chinhama.mlplace.ca (subscription options available)\ngiving: https://www.sim.ca/missionary-donate-p8251.php  Missionary Number: 064203\n','Catching Up','','publish','open','closed','','catching-up','','','2014-11-18 08:27:47','2014-11-18 15:27:47','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=224',0,'post','',0),(226,3,'2014-11-18 08:09:34','2014-11-18 15:09:34','','IMG_2380[1]','','inherit','open','closed','','img_23801','','','2014-11-18 08:09:34','2014-11-18 15:09:34','',0,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23801.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(227,3,'2014-11-18 08:13:28','2014-11-18 15:13:28','','IMG_2362[1]','','inherit','open','closed','','img_23621','','','2014-11-18 08:13:28','2014-11-18 15:13:28','',224,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23621.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(228,3,'2014-11-18 08:14:43','2014-11-18 15:14:43','','IMG_9843 copy','','inherit','open','closed','','img_9843-copy','','','2014-11-18 08:14:43','2014-11-18 15:14:43','',0,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_9843-copy.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(229,3,'2014-11-18 08:15:40','2014-11-18 15:15:40','','IMG_9844 copy','','inherit','open','closed','','img_9844-copy','','','2014-11-18 08:15:40','2014-11-18 15:15:40','',224,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_9844-copy.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(230,3,'2014-11-18 08:18:24','2014-11-18 15:18:24','','IMG_2375[1]','','inherit','open','closed','','img_23751','','','2014-11-18 08:18:24','2014-11-18 15:18:24','',224,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_23751.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(234,3,'2014-12-01 06:51:56','2014-12-01 13:51:56','Turtle Tuesday 25 Nov 2014 (internet issues have kept me from posting, sorry!)\n\nAlmost every morning I ask Afonso what his plans are for the day. He often asks, “Why?” I guess I ask mostly in order to coordinate our use of the car, our meal plans, and shared responsibilities. In spite of Angola’s influence in making me more flexible over the years, I’m still a “What’s the plan?” kinda girl.\n\nWe did it! Yesterday afternoon while Yva napped and the rain poured down, Afonso and I had a discipleship team meeting. Although we have a lot of details to work out, it really helps to have some ideas on paper; some concrete action plans in place for the coming weeks and a rough idea of what to expect in the coming year. What a difference it makes to have a plan! We now plan to meet weekly to study and evaluate some discipleship materials together before we teach others to use the tools in the coming year. As part of that, we already had quite a good discussion about eternal security this morning.\n\nOn Saturday morning Afonso was off around 8am to lead a small group at one of our daughter churches. At 10am Yva and I were getting into the car to go to kids choir practise at church, and noticed a lot of movement in the parking lot of the neighboring UIEA church headquarters. Judging by who was around, it looked suspiciously like a national directors meeting. That seemed strange, since the monthly meetings are normally held on Tuesdays. The coordinator for women’s ministry looked surprised when I told her that Afonso was out at a small group and that we too were on our way out. About an hour later we found out why! We were supposed to be at the meeting in order for Afonso to be officially installed as the Discipleship Coordinator for the denomination, the role he was appointed to at the assembly in early October. We hadn’t been told of the plan! Not only that, at the meeting we found out that the role includes membership in the directors committee. That was not in our plans - we thought that the discipleship sector would be represented at the national level by the Director of Evangelism. It means that, even more than we planned or expected, Afonso has a voice in shaping the vision and working of our denomination. He will also experience a lot of S.I.M. (Sitting In Meetings! One of our fun acronyms for our mission organization).\n\n“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, declares the LORD.” Is. 55:8\n\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\nSIM Angola\nEmail version sent from Chinhama.mlplace.ca\nDonations: https://www.sim.ca/missionary-donate-p8251.php missionary # 064203\n\n\n','What’s the Plan?','','publish','open','closed','','whats-the-plan','','','2014-12-01 06:51:56','2014-12-01 13:51:56','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=234',0,'post','',0),(239,3,'2015-01-07 14:17:30','2015-01-07 21:17:30','Turtle \"Tuesday\" 07 January 2015\nOur month long hiatus from our updates is over.

Pray for wisdom as we figure out what works for us - this is new territory!\n+ we are in need of ministry funds to cover our travel to Ethiopia ($4591 from Lubango) and our in-country travel (as high as $5260  just until July, with expected follow-up training in the same 6 regions and 2 more retreats in the second half of the year)\n+ we need to pull together a bit more equipment for our travel &amp; presentations.

Here in Angola we are not. Believe it or not, our fuel prices have gone up by 50% in the past month, and are expected to keep rising to double what they were. Up until a month ago, we were paying LOW fuel prices, less than 40c. per litre for diesel, and less than 60c. for gasoline. HOWEVER, the national government budget depends almost solely on international oil sales. In order to make ends meet, the government has quickly started heavily taxing domestic fuel sales.\n\nOur currency also has suffered. Over the past few months, the exchange rate has gone from about 110 Kwanzas/USD to at least 125 Kwanzas/USD. For those of us who receive our allowance from outside Angola, our in-country buying power so far remains more or less in balance with the rising costs. For most folks, however, it\'s time to tighten their belts.\n\nIn Angola, nearly all vehicles on the market are imported, which means that prices are set in foreign currency and fluctuate with exchange rates. Import taxes are high. We\'ve been looking into selling our 10 year old car and importing a new one through an organization that caters to non-profit organizations (at a good price). When we started looking into it, this seemed like a viable idea. Now with the exchange rate being so high, it will be difficult to find a local buyer willing to pay the USD equivalent we need in order to be able to afford a new vehicle. We have a small reserve built up from mileage payments, but were counting on a good selling price to pay the bulk of a new vehicle. There\'s a great Umbundu word to express exasperation, \"UPANGE!\" The longer we drive our car, the less we can ask as a sale price, and the more we\'ll spend in repairs and maintenance. What to do? Oh Lord, we need Your wisdom!\n\nSide notes:\n1. We learned yesterday about a new regulation that deems Yva too young to start kindergarten until NEXT February. There MAY be an exception granted but we likely have to re-think what Yva\'s education looks like this year. Please  pray for patience as we wait to hear, and for wisdom. \n2. The youth conference at which Afonso was to travel and speak this week was postponed until Easter.\n3. We have an offer from a colleague to lend us a data projector, complete with hard-sided travel case, for the foreseeable future.\n3.

After all the thefts we\'ve suffered while living in this house, you\'d think we would always be on our guard. We should keep the kitchen door latched, if not locked, while we\'re inside the house. But we don\'t. OK, we did add a barking dog to our security repertoire, but even we should probably stay more alert. Praise the LORD we\'ve had no thefts since arriving back in Angola just over a year ago.\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2220.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_2220-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2220\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-245\" /></a>\n\nFood restrictions are part of our daily lives. Every time we\'re offered food we ask questions about the ingredients. Shopping is a slow process because I read ingredient lists on every product that\'s not a regular purchase. Even so, yesterday we found out to what extent Yva reacts to peanuts. They were GLUTEN FREE cookies, and we made sure they were DAIRY FREE. . . but we let our guard down and didn\'t think to ask about PEANUT BUTTER! After taking a bite or two of the cookie and spitting it out, she was coughing, wheezing, sneezing and vomiting - but BREATHING! Praise the LORD, it could have been worse! We should have an epi pen in hand by next week. Please pray that we will all stay more alert so that this doesn\'t happen again. In case it does, pray that we will ALWAYS have the epi pen with us.\n“Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” 1 Cor. 16:13 NASB\n“Estejam vigilantes, mantenham-se firmes na fé, sejam homens de coragem, sejam fortes.” 1 Cor. 16:13 NVI\n\nPRAYER POINTS:\n*Please pray that we\'ll be able to finalize our flights to Ethiopia, we seem to be having technical difficulties with our online booking. \n*As far as we know, we haven\'t yet received any donations to cover our flights to Ethiopia, so please pray for God\'s provision.

Despite our longing, these past few weeks we\'ve realized one of the blessings of having only one child: we have fewer sleepless nights with sick kids! First it was anaphylaxis, then amoebas last week, and now a cough. Do those of you with lots of kids get any sleep or is there always someone sick?\n\nSince we\'re counting our blessings, here\'s another! A few posts back we mentioned a list of equipment we need for our many road trips this year. A colleague surprised us with four brand new stacking totes - the exact type we would have bought for ourselves. Yay!\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2643.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2643-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2643\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-252\" /></a>\n\nOn Yva\'s behalf, I count the blessing of a small but significant gift from other colleagues - a tiny little purse. She shows it off to EVERYONE and carries it EVERYWHERE! \n\nWe\'re blessed to belong to a mission that grants us flexibility. We still haven\'t received word of any donations for our trip to Ethiopia, but SIM Canada has allowed us to book our tickets in faith. Unfortunately our online booking didn\'t work out, and we\'ve had to book through an agency, so our Luanda-Addis Ababa flights ring in at $5099 CAD, almost $1,000 more than we were expecting. We\'re SO looking forward to this opportunity and are counting down the days! Everything on the program is relevant to us as we launch this disciplemaking initiative here in Angola. Beyond doing lots of reading, I don\'t recall doing any professional development since coming to Angola. I\'m starved for a learning environment and look forward to wrestling through the \"HOW?\" of discipleship in Africa together with other missionaries and church leaders from across the continent.\n\nHere\'s an Ethiopian flag that Yva and I made together:\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2644.jpg\"><img src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_2644-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2644\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-253\" /></a>\n\nWe count it a blessing that you and many others entrust us with doing Kingdom work. As we\'ve read and heard and studied about Spiritual Gifts lately, we realize what a privilege it is to be able to do what we love and are being equipped by the Spirit to do. It\'s an added blessing that we get to work together in ministry - it\'s not common among our Angolan colleagues.\n\nPrayer requests:\n1. Health, especially for our upcoming travels.\n2. God\'s provision of funds for our trip to Ethiopia, and our upcoming road trips.\n3. That the conference in Ethiopia will be worthwhile\n4.

These are the first small steps taken towards building the capacity of pastors and lay leaders for the work of transformational discipleship.\nThe project aims to provide resources for and to launch a disciple-making movement in the denomination. Twenty (20) regional leaders will participate in four retreats where they will be trained as coaches, encouraged, and given opportunity to report on the work of discipleship in their region. Each of the six administrative regions of the UIEA will benefit from two three-day training sessions about the importance of discipleship. Five leaders from each of the approximately 130 autonomous churches (pastors, women\'s ministry leaders, youth leaders) will receive training in how to use the \"Foundations of Discipleship\" materials. Once trained, each of these 650 participants will be encouraged to form a small group of ten church members under their leadership, for which materials will be subsidized. National and regional coaches will have subsidized mobile phone credit for the work of encouraging and monitoring the work of discipleship in their region. As a fundamental need of the project and future ongoing sustainability of the discipleship work, a vehicle will be acquired for the use of the UIEA Discipleship Coordinator, Afonso Chinhama, who is also a SIM Canada missionary</em>.\n\nWhat does this mean? Not that we are guaranteed funding, only that we now have the right to fundraise to cover the expenses of the discipleship training we\'re embarking on. The process of project writing was very helpful to clarify what we\'re setting out to accomplish. We\'re excited! If you are interested in seeing the whole proposal, just let us know and we can send it by email.\n\nPrayer requests:\n+ We\'ve changed our plans and will be making a road trip for our first regional training session before going to Ethiopia. We\'ll visit Luanda on the way back from Ethiopia rather than on the way as we had planned. This means we have LOTS to organize this week!\n+ Still no word of funding for our Ethiopia trip.\n+ Pray that our project proposal will generate funding so that our ministry can reach further than it would without funding.\n+ My computer is being really finnicky - this simple cut and paste post has taken almost an hour to write because of my computer freezing up every few words.

I have some dishes to do, laundry to fold, and a power point presentation or two to finish up. \n\nThis first training session is going to require a lot of thinking on our feet and adapting our material as we go. \"Firsts\" are like that! As part of a larger pastors conference, we have been given three sessions of approximately 1.5 hours each. The province we\'re visiting is primarily Nganguela speaking, so we will likely be working with translation, so our time will be nearly cut in half! We don\'t plan to go deep into discipleship training, but give motivation and an overview of what will be coming up in our follow up training in October. We\'ve been reminded again of our TURTLE theme: slow and steady wins the race.

I will keep trying to upload pictures and fill you in on the many many happenings since then....\n\nTurtle Thursday 05 March 2015\n\nHave you ever tried drinking from a fire hose?? Me neither, but I imagine that the last 6 days come close for us on a spiritual, intellectual and life-directing intake level. It will take days and months to process all we\'ve been exposed to here in Ethiopia. \n\nEvery now and then throughout my life I\'ve found myself in a place or circumstance that I would never have imagined. It was incredible to meet with thousands of church leaders from all over Africa, and SURREAL to meet in the facilities of the African Union. Our keynote speaker was Edmund Chan, founder of an organization called IDMC, Intentional DiscipleMaking Churches. His and all the other presentations were Biblical, challenging and practical. We especially appreciated the fact that we were continually redirected to Jesus and the Word instead of to programs, materials and strategies.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday we had the chance to visit the International Evangelical church, a traditional coffee shop, the Holy Trinity Cathedral, and a restaurant named after Lucy, once thought to be the oldest human remains ever discovered.\n\nFrom Sunday night through yesterday evening we were in an intense workshop to wrestle with more practical matters of discipleship with about 40 other missionaries from around Africa and church workers from here in Ethiopia. We had lots of helpful group discussions following presentations from various people including Dr. Obed and his wife Chi from Nigeria. Again, HUGELY inspiring, deeply Biblical, and incredibly practical. Hearing from each others experience was really enriching. \n\n\n\nSince we\'re still reeling from the \"fire hose\" experience, I don\'t even know what else to say! We still have one more big experience planned: the Discipleship coordinator for the Kale Hewit church plans to take Afonso and I out on Saturday through Sunday morning to visit a pastors discipleship training centre. We\'ll have the chance to observe the \"graduation ceremony\" of a group of pastors from their two year training program.\n\nWe couldn\'t do this all without Mom!! She and Yva have been having a blast! The only drawback is that we\'ve been too busy to get much visiting in with Mom.

BIG. When it comes to discipleship in Africa. We had a glimpse of it every day in Ethiopia. On our weekend trip out of Addis we attended the commissioning service of 26 pastors who completed a two year disciple making pastors training (DMPT) program. The church where they met is one of something like 200 centres where this training is taking place. Pastor\'s lives and ministries are being transformed as they get into the Word and apply it. Consequently, the Body of Christ is growing and being strengthened.\n\nEven better, we get to be on the front lines as similar things begin to take place in Angola! Front lines means we\'ll likely face opposition and discouragement along the way. Right now, though, along with the weight of responsibility, we sense that we\'re privileged to be part of what God is doing.\n\nWe left Ethiopia already over two weeks ago. Life hasn\'t slowed down much! We had 4 days in Luanda on our way back, and then about that many at home to re-group for our next phase of pastors training and leadership retreats. Yva and I bowed out of this week\'s road trip to try and recover from the coughs and colds that have been hanging on for much too long. Afonso and our church president and general secretary had a two day turnaround. We just heard from Afonso that they arrived safely at their destination after nearly 12 hours on the road. He is complaining of a scratchy throat, please pray for health and strength.\n\nThis past weekend we led a retreat for our national and regional church leaders. As we shared from what we learned in Ethiopia, and as we practised small group dynamics, we repeatedly heard, \"I\'ve been hearing about discipleship since 2011, but I finally GET IT!\" These leaders as well as all the pastors we\'re training region by region, are being challenged to keep a daily journal of their time in the Word. They are being encouraged to practise the small group model amongst pastoral couples in their vicinity. Later on they\'ll take that to their local congregations. Let\'s see what God will do!\n\nGuess what!? You are part of this big thing too!

I think we were more tired than we realized.\n\nThe trip Yva and I missed was not an easy one. Chitembo, where the Huambo/Bié region chose to hold the pastors training, is a 10-11 hour drive from here. Many of those hours were through heavy rain and many were nighttime driving, which Afonso and I prefer not to do. Since Afonso went as a passenger and left us with the car, he thankfully didn\'t have to face the dark from behind the wheel. We\'re so thankful for safety on the roads!\n\nThere were 98 participants in this past training. Once again, all the sessions were translated into Nganguela. The cry is that we translate the discipleship materials we have into Nganguela. In this region, very few of the pastors are young and well educated. In the past, a grade 4 education was required to enter the Bible Institute, so many of them don\'t have more that, and many church members have that or even less. Discipleship doesn\'t require literacy, it requires being transformed into the likeness of Christ! However, we are wrestling with mechanisms for training disciplemakers and tools for study and growth amongst speakers of other languages and amongst semi-literate church members.\n\nWe\'re looking forward now to a few weeks at home. We have lots of work to do, and we all need the re establishment of routine and discipline.\n\nA number of you have asked about finances. Our plane tickets to Ethiopia came to just over $5000 CAD, and we\'ve had official word that about 1/3 of that has been covered by donations so far. That\'s our most acute need for the moment. The time in Ethiopia was very worthwhile and used by God, so we trust that He will provide through further generosity.\n\nPhotos!? - Lord willing, this internet connection will cooperate and I\'ll have a bunch of photos uploaded by the time most of you open your emails. You\'ll be able to find them at chinhama.mlplace.ca.\n\nWe watched the Jesus film for children last night. This morning Yva was re-counting many scenes to me, and we got into a discussion about the Trinity. She finds it so funny that God has a Son who is God. If I remember right, one of her questions was \"How come God loves Himself?\" Just a bit of \"light\" 4-year-old theology for our reflection this Easter weekend.

not looking terribly hopeful, but I will write in hopes that I can send sooner rather than later. We keep getting glimmers of hope that our internet is truly FIXED, but it’s never that simple. We did have a few good days of internet in between and were able to get at some online accounts. That’s our big news for this week.\nI made a nice graph to give this all to you in visual format, but I still haven’t had enough time online to learn how to publish it, so in the meantime, you get the plain facts in Canadian dollars!\n\nMONTHLY SUPPORT:\nGoal: $4565.54 per month\nAverage monthly received since October, including some HUGE one time gifts: $4111.55\nMarch 2015 support: $3225 – this is “normal” – without one time gifts, and represents faithful, sacrificial giving of many of you who are reading this update\nTotal cumulative support deficit: $5883 (we entered this fiscal year with a deficit)\n\nHOME ASSIGNMENT 2013:\nRemaining deficit: $2198.98\nA reminder of how this happened – up until Sept 2013 I was on “single” support and so travel amounts were set for ONE person, but THREE of us flew, with extra costs added because of visa delays etc. As this is still in debt, we run the risk of not having sufficient travel funds saved up for our next home assignment.\n\nETHIOPIA TRIP:\nGoal: $5042.63\nThis is JUST the Luanda-Addis flight, we had many other expenses that were covered by us and my parents (thanks!)\nRemaining deficit: $2695.74\n\nTOTAL RECEIVED October-March: $25,061.77 WOW! Thanks to all of you who have been part of this! We are blessed, and in spite of bleak accounts, we have clothes, housing, food, and promising ministry.\n\nTOTAL DEFICITS: $10,777.72\n\nThe other news from online is the launch of SIM Canada’s new website. Check it out at www.sim.ca. You won’t find our profile there yet – we still need to take and send in a photo! We should be on there soon, but in the meantime you can set up your “My SIM” account and learn your way around. Donations are accepted, even without our profile, as long as you include our name or our missionary number: 064203. One of the new features is “start a campaign”. Even if your accounts are looking like ours, that’s a way you could consider helping us with our shortfalls – by raising awareness of our ministry and our needs. Another is to PRAY. The Lord has no shortage of funds, pray that He’ll free up what we need. We are SO thankful for the generosity of many that keeps us going.\n\nIf you have questions about our ministry or our finances, please let us know!\n\nNext road trip/pastor’s training: Next Tuesday, 1000km to Luanda.\nBlessings,\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\nSIM Angola\nwww.sim.ca\nChinhama.mlplace.ca','Online!?','','publish','open','closed','','online','','','2015-04-16 13:26:48','2015-04-16 19:26:48','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=299',0,'post','',0),(303,3,'2015-05-04 15:08:29','2015-05-04 21:08:29','<span style=\"color: #000000\">I know, it\'s not Tuesday, but this has been waiting for our internet to get better.

Afonso said the other day, “I don’t care to hear people say they enjoyed our presentations and that we had relevant things to say. I want to hear down the road that they are putting into practise what we’ve taught and oriented.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\"><a style=\"color: #000000\" href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-306\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"photo 1\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" /></a></span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Reading a crowd is tough. Luanda, like the other regions in which we’ve participated in pastors training, has unique challenges. We didn’t get a lot of feedback from the participants, but the little we heard was all positive. Will the teaching be put into practise? The other sessions and interaction in Luanda showed us that there is a history of conflict in the churches and the leadership of the region. Since the first step toward building a disciple-making church is equipping disciple-making pastors, the first challenge we’re leaving in each region is for the pastors to practise small group dynamics as pastor couples. Pray with us that these pastor couples will begin meeting together to study the Word, to fellowship, to pray for one another, and to keep each other accountable for their own personal time in the Word. As this happens, pray for transformation. Until we as leaders are growing in Christ-likeness, beginning with disciple-making in our congregations will be fruitless. If I’m not mistaken, there were 36 participants in this training weekend.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\"> </span>\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-307\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-2.jpg\" alt=\"photo 2\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" /></a>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Luanda was HOT and someone stretched the road to make it seem longer than 1000km from here, but we’re back home again. Yva had a bit of fever the last night there, and again on the way home, but after a good night’s sleep seems to be back to normal and doesn’t even want her afternoon nap. She did get a lot of insect bites of varying types during her long hours of playing with other kids in the church yard. Please pray that she doesn’t have malaria incubating in her system. I’m always amazed by Yva’s adaptability. As soon as she found the other children that came with their parents to this training, we hardly saw her for the rest of the weekend. And she complained very little about the long road. Of course, movies, games, songs, snacks and potty breaks help along the way – for all of us!</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\"> <a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-308\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-4.jpg\" alt=\"photo 4\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" /></a></span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Blessings,</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">Afonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">SIM Angola</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">www.sim.ca</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000\">posted at chinhama.mlplace.ca</span>','The Proof is in the Pudding','','publish','open','closed','','the-proof-is-in-the-pudding','','','2015-05-04 15:08:29','2015-05-04 21:08:29','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=303',0,'post','',0),(306,3,'2015-05-04 15:00:48','2015-05-04 21:00:48','','photo 1','','inherit','open','closed','','photo-1','','','2015-05-04 15:00:48','2015-05-04 21:00:48','',303,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(307,3,'2015-05-04 15:01:01','2015-05-04 21:01:01','','photo 2','','inherit','open','closed','','photo-2','','','2015-05-04 15:01:01','2015-05-04 21:01:01','',303,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(308,3,'2015-05-04 15:01:29','2015-05-04 21:01:29','','photo 4','','inherit','open','closed','','photo-4','','','2015-05-04 15:01:29','2015-05-04 21:01:29','',303,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-4.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(311,3,'2015-05-15 10:47:33','2015-05-15 16:47:33','Turtle Friday 15 May 15\n\n\"...There is daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?\" 2 Cor. 11:28-29\n\nAs we travel the country, we are gaining a perspective and concern for the church, something like Paul\'s in the verse above. It\'s a very good thing that the Church is God\'s and not ours, \'cause we sure don\'t know how to bring health and strength to it! We do think, however, that discipleship is one of the tools that God will use, and that God uniquely prepared us for the strategic task he\'s given us.\n\nI was telling \"my girls\" about my sense of responsibility for THEM the other day. Years ago I gathered a group of adolescent girls from our church together and we talked about things like dating, prayer, the fear of God, what kind of men they should wait for, abortion. Alongside that we did crafts. For the past 2 years we haven\'t had consistent meetings, since we were away, and then life was so full of uncertainty last year. Most of those girls are now getting beyond their teen years, a few have started university, and life is changing. They are much busier than they used to be, and we\'re having trouble finding a good time to meet, but I\'ve been feeling so burdened for them. Within a few years they\'ll all likely be starting marriages and careers. I want them to be ready. Even though we\'re on the road a lot, I\'ve been trying to meet with them for a more focused growth group. We\'ve dispensed with the crafts and want to make sure they\'re spending time in the Word on their own, and will hopefully soon start studying through the discipleship materials we are using with the pastors around the country. So far we have no momentum - other church programs and LIFE seem to get in the way of meeting weekly. Pray for us - there\'s about 10 girls who could be part of the group, all of whom are Sunday School or Kids Club teachers at our church.\n\nWe are enjoying extra time at home. We were scheduled for pastors training in Namibe province this week, but due to other events in the churches there, the event was postponed until further notice. We\'re a bit out of sync and don\'t have enough routine for this many days at home in a row!! Pray that we\'ll use our time wisely. Our next pastor\'s training is in our home region at the end of the month, and that starts a kinda crazy season again:\n\n28-30 May - Pastor\'s training, Huila/Kunene provinces, at Tchincombe ranch\n\n11-13 June - UIEA leadership Discipleship retreat, at Dondi Mission, Kuito province (we are responsible for the program)\n\n18-20 June - Pastor\'s training, Moxico province - we would like to fly, so pray that the currently grounded MAF planes can get the needed paperwork to get back in the air by then\n\n9-14 July - annual Spiritual Life Conference for our mission community (we are on the planning committee)\n\n17-31 July - vacation time  - not sure what we\'ll do, pray for something fun and restful\n\nThanks for your partnership!\n\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\n\nSIM Angola\n\nposted to chinhama.mlplace.ca\n\ndonations and more info: www.sim.ca','My Girls','','publish','open','closed','','my-girls','','','2015-05-15 10:47:33','2015-05-15 16:47:33','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=311',0,'post','',0),(314,3,'2015-06-05 10:01:21','2015-06-05 16:01:21','One of our supporting churches asked us to answer some specific questions for their Spring Missions Focus last weekend. Since I haven\'t had time to write anything else, I\'m sending the questions and and answers to all of you. Some of it will be review, some may be news.. . .\n<ul>\n	<li>What projects or goals are you working on with your mission organization currently?</li>\n</ul>\nWe are in process of discipleship training with all the pastors in our partner denomination, region by region. In this very first phase of our discipleship training we\'re helping them to understand what discipleship is, it\'s importance, and how it will be integrated into their future ministry. The first two steps we leave with the pastors are disciplined personal quiet time, and to experience small group dynamics as pastor couples. If they never experience discipleship they cannot reproduce discipleship in their churches.\n<ul>\n	<li>How are you being intentional in your day to day life? (in regards to reaching out to people)</li>\n</ul>\nOne big intentional step of our ministry is personal contact by telephone with all the national and regional leadership of our denomination. Afonso sends text messages twice a week and calls all 22 of them once each every two weeks. As we travel the country, we keep hearing from them how that in itself has encouraged them, united them, and helped them to understand what discipleship looks like.\n<ul>\n	<li>What is your most memorable moment with another person recently?</li>\n</ul>\nWe just finished our training weekend in our home region yesterday. One of the lay leaders who rode back with us in the car said to us, \"Every other pastors training I\'ve been at has been focused on pastoral etiquette. The Biblical teaching we received was always something to take and teach others, without having to let it touch us personally. This time we were challenged on a personal level and I\'ve realized how short I fall.\" We\'re excited because without that perspective of personal need and personal transformation, there\'s no point implementing a discipleship vision.\n\nAnother one: a few weeks ago I, Becky, was meeting with my small group of youth girls and each of them shared their salvation story. I don\'t think most of them had done that before, and each of them and me walked away with a new \"wow\" in our hearts.\n<ul>\n	<li>What are your current struggles? (With ministry and/or personal)</li>\n</ul>\n1.We travel a lot and it\'s tiring.\n\n2. Sometimes we travel in fear that our 10 year old vehicle is going to let us down.\n\n3.In spite of many new supporters since our last home assignment,  we are also still under supported, and that wears on us too.\n<ul>\n	<li>How can we be praying for you specifically right now?</li>\n</ul>\nWe have two big events in June. One is a strategic retreat of the national and regional leadership (14-16). We are trying to do this every quarter. The last one was incredible, and we\'re praying that this one will be even better. There will be some first time attenders, pray that they\'ll catch the vision and that the open, humble atmosphere of the last retreat will carry into this retreat too. The other event is our 5th regional training (21-23), the biggest challenge being distance. Driving the most direct route, it\'s a 1600 km, two day drive on roads we\'re not sure our car can handle with it\'s broken 4x4. One option is taking the 14 hour train ride for the second half where the roads are worse. The Lord could also work out the bureaucratic hitch that\'s keeping the MAF planes on the ground, so that we could make the trip in a few hours instead of days.\nBlessings from Angola!\n\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\n\nSIM Angola\n\nposted to Chinhama.mlplace.ca - subscription options available\n\ndonation options available at www.sim.ca','Q & A','','publish','open','closed','','q-a','','','2015-06-05 10:01:21','2015-06-05 16:01:21','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=314',0,'post','',0),(317,3,'2015-06-15 04:10:24','2015-06-15 10:10:24','Turtle Thursday 11 June 2015\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGreetings from Dondi! We\'re about 8 hours from home at our quarterly discipleship retreat. There are 15 adults and 2 kids attending. Since we have 27 on our list and Afonso was incredibly diligent in his communication, we were pretty frustrated at the last minute drop out rate! The biggest disappointment was one pastor who was motivated and planning to come but at the last minute was told that there was not enough money to pay his transportation. We had arranged a donation for his return trip, he just had to get here....\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow that things are underway we\'re less discouraged.

Many of these pastors have little or no experience in this area, so their focus tends to turn automatically to teaching and preaching. Today we had lots of time to hear personal and regional reports, pray, play games, discuss the centrality of the Word, and learn from Jesus\' models of discipleship. All in a very interactive style. The rest if the program will be similar, finishing on Saturday with lunch. It\'s a full schedule and judging how tired we are already at the end of the first day, we\'re going to be wiped out by the end!! It would be nice if we had more days and could have a less intense schedule!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTurtle Sunday, 14 June\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe\'re home!! We spent an extra night in the Huambo area, one of the benefits being driving home only in daylight. There\'s one pastor who hasn\'t completed his return trip by bus yet, but the rest all travelled safely PTL!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn our debrief-in-the-car we concluded that the highlight of our retreat surrounded our denominational president\'s personal sharing time. Things got emotional as quite a number of us were able to affirm and encourage him in his walk with God and in his leadership. One of the first time attenders said, \"This retreat is a dream come true for me. Imagine that I would have the chance to take part in meetings where we don\'t do business but I get to sit and talk about walking with God together with my colleagues and even our president. It\'s such a blessing that he opened the door for discipleship in our denomination. It\'s a dream come true.\" Wow, what an answer to our prayers!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_321\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"604\"]<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3244.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-321\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3244-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"one of our teaching sessions at Dondi\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a> one of our teaching sessions at Dondi[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_319\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"604\"]<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3263.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-319\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3263-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"guided tour with the Director of the Dondi Mission\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" /></a> guided tour with the Director of the Dondi Mission[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe decided that Yva and I would stay home this coming week and Afonso would travel as a passenger to Luena for the next regional pastors training.

We\'re on the planning committee so we are going early to help set up. We are excited to host our SIM International Director as our speaker this year and are looking forward to his teaching, as well as fun and fellowship.\n\nOur weeks at home were busy. Afonso had daily opportunity to exercise his gift of helps and spent hours and hours organizing things for others, like used clothes donations at church, a new window for a colleague\'s broken-into car, a title deed for an absent friend\'s property, and many other things. I\'ve been busy mostly with conference organization, getting caught up on expense and mileage claims, and writing a report of Christian education activities over the past six months.\n\nIn terms of our discipleship project, the big news is, we\'ve been granted $35,000 towards our nearly $150,000 total project costs. Such a help... But now we have to figure out what the priorities are. Pray for wisdom! We want to see disciples made...

All the work of helping organize, set up, and run the conference, while camping, was tiring, but worth it.\n\nWe had the privilege of hosting our SIM International director, Joshua Bogunjoko, as our conference speaker. He took us through Philippians, mining the language of Gospel teams. His insights were fresh, challenging and practical. We praise God for Joshua\'s servant leadership!\n\nWe also had a lot of fun, worship, good food and fellowship. Well, I didn\'t get enough - I seemed to be running around organizing things too much and missed out on some of the fun. Next year Yva will be 5, even more independant, and we won\'t be on the organizing committee, so I should be able to sit back and enjoy it more. We didn\'t take any photos but hope to get our hands on some from friends.\n\nWe\'ve been home from conference for two weeks already. Besides our general weariness, Afonso also came down with malaria.  He is almost back to normal and we are all getting a bit more energetic, albeit ready for some vacation time!\n\nAll of our vacation dates have been changed around multiple times, and some of our plans are still up in the air. We have never taken  a real vacation before ;-/  but we\'re disciplining ourselves to make it happen somehow this year. Currently we are booked off from August 6-20 to visit Namibe and Huambo in Angola, and from September 15-30 to visit Etosha National Park and Swakopmund in Namibia. The vacation hiatus from August 21st through September 15th will be FULL:\n\n20-22 August - National UIEA Women\'s Conference, Kuito (8-9 hr. from here, but only about an hour from Huambo where we\'ll be vacationing) with a session from us on Discipleship, where we plan to focus on BEING a disciple\n\n24-30 August - Anniversary week of the local church in Kuito, Afonso will preach 6 times about discipleship, and we\'ll have time to encourage the church, who reportedly have been actively discipling their members. We expect to learn from them!\n\n31 Aug-08 Sept - Home to catch up with ourselves a bit and organize our retreats and busy travel schedule for October and November.\n\n09-12 Sept - Afonso at annual business meetings of the UIEA denomination in Menongue (+/-7 hr. from here)\n\nTHANK YOU for your partnership.

There were seven of us the first time and five the second, and we\'ll be meeting now every other week. Some are still harvesting their corn, so we might be a bit sporadic\"\n\nYahoo!! This is the first ripple beginning to form - pastors meeting together to study the Word, pray, fellowship, and keep each other accountable to be spending daily time in Scripture. So far, we\'ve visited four regions and have given that same challenge to about 275 people - pastors, lay leaders and their wives. We\'ve received feedback that some have begun meeting in small localized groups, but won\'t have the full picture until we make our follow-up visits in October and November.\n\nThe call was out-of-the-blue unexpected, but what\'s beginning to happen is straight from God\'s heart.\n\nIn other news...\n\nAlthough we\'ve postponed our next home assignment until 2017, we expect to make a short visit to Alberta in May 2016.

OLD NEWS .. .  I will write every few days now to get you caught up\n\nAfonso was born in Huambo but left when he was young. Beyond going for a few family funerals, he hadn\'t been back. I had previously only stopped in Huambo on my way through. Five vacation days there gave us a feel for the city. We took a picnic lunch each day and did some exploring. We all enjoyed getting to know our American friends Danny and Katie Reese with their kids better, and were encouraged by discussions about house construction, DiscipleMaking and parenting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was hard to recall the rested feeling we had after those few vacation days in Huambo, because things got so busy so quickly...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAround 600 women came together in Kuito for the UIEA national women\'s conference. The days were long and full, so we\'re glad that Yva got to enjoy time at the local pastor\'s home while we participated in the conference. The women were \"bombarded\" with full days of sessions, I personally found it hard to retain even one point from each topic. I made a bit of a scene climbing up a wobbly step ladder to speak about stages of personal growth. Please pray that God will use the growth challenge that we gave in our session. As Afonso keeps saying, \"I don\'t want positive feedback that our session was good, I want to hear that you\'re putting something into practise.\" Only a handful of the women raised their hands to say they had any kind of daily time in the Word of God. We left them with the challenge to read or listen through the New Testament this year, and (for the literate) to keep a notebook to track questions, observations, and plans to live in obedience to the Word. As a reminder to keep a notebook, I explained how they could easily make a pretty fabric cover for their notebooks. I\'ve been interacting with one pastor\'s wife who already was in the Word, but can\'t get over how much she\'s learning as she\'s now tracking her journey in a fabric covered notebook. Pray that other women will have similar experiences.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTHEN Afonso got busy! He preached 6 times to the local congregation in Kuito, challenging them to a life of authentic discipleship. A good number of people expressed a desire to become disciples of Jesus and others renewed their commitment to follow Jesus.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was a TOUGH week for Afonso and we considered returning home mid week. Afonso was suffering quite severe pain in his abdomen, to the point where he couldn\'t bend down to tie his shoes. Kuito has no private clinics, and the government hospital (like many around the country) is suffering a severe shortage of doctors. He showed some improvement through the week so he pushed through. Nothing showed up in the tests he had when we returned home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can hardly use the word \"return\" in that last sentence. Afonso was home for 36 hours before heading to Menongue for annual Executive meetings of the UIEA. Needless to say, he came home from THAT trip completely exhausted! For someone who rarely slows down, he\'s spent a lot of time sprawled on the sofa this past week. He seems to be perking up now, in time for our next trip!\n\n( That trip has already come and gone. .. . more news and some photos in the coming days)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfonso, Becky and Yva Chinhama\n\nSIM Angola\n\nwww.sim.ca for info and donation options\n\nposted to chinhama.mlplace.ca - subscription options available','Beginning to Catch Up','','publish','open','closed','','beginning-to-catch-up','','','2015-09-30 10:02:19','2015-09-30 16:02:19','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=345',0,'post','',0),(347,3,'2015-10-02 13:50:56','2015-10-02 19:50:56','','IMG_3405','PK friends in Huambo','inherit','open','closed','','img_3405','','','2015-10-02 13:50:56','2015-10-02 19:50:56','',356,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3405.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(348,3,'2015-10-02 13:52:05','2015-10-02 19:52:05','','IMG_3419','Worship and Bible study with friends in Huambo.','inherit','open','closed','','img_3419','','','2015-10-02 13:52:05','2015-10-02 19:52:05','',356,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3419.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(349,3,'2015-10-02 13:53:16','2015-10-02 19:53:16','','IMG_3454','Youth camp Becky spoke at in Kuito','inherit','open','closed','','img_3454','','','2015-10-02 13:53:16','2015-10-02 19:53:16','',356,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3454.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(350,3,'2015-10-02 13:54:01','2015-10-02 19:54:01','','IMG_3456','The congregation in Kuito where Afonso preached for their anniversary week.','inherit','open','closed','','img_3456','','','2015-10-02 13:54:01','2015-10-02 19:54:01','',356,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3456-e1443815950457.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(351,3,'2015-10-02 13:54:12','2015-10-02 19:54:12','','IMG_3561','sand dune selfie','inherit','open','closed','','img_3561','','','2015-10-02 13:54:12','2015-10-02 19:54:12','',356,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3561-e1443816316612.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(352,3,'2015-10-02 13:54:41','2015-10-02 19:54:41','','IMG_3607','great driver!','inherit','open','closed','','img_3607','','','2015-10-02 13:54:41','2015-10-02 19:54:41','',356,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3607-e1443816218374.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(353,3,'2015-10-02 13:55:15','2015-10-02 19:55:15','','IMG_3613','Yva\'s 5th Birthday breakfast.

In both previous retreats, God surprised us in different ways, breaking into our plans with \"wow!\" moments. Out of 30 people invited to participate, we have 14 on our list this time - one of whom is a first timer. We don\'t feel ready. We have about 40 hours until departure to complete the food shopping and finalize the schedule and content, 16 hours of which we should be sleeping. Pray with us that the Lord will surprise us once again - that these retreats will never become routine. Pray that the participants will come with an attitude of expectancy and vulnerability, and that we\'ll be sensitive to God as He orchestrates whatever it is that He chooses to accomplish in and through us. We head out to \"the farm\" on Wednesday afternoon and plan to be home on Sunday by dark.\r\n\r\nAnd here\'s a photo I missed last time - the rickety stepladder I used to illustrate phases of spiritual growth for the national women\'s conference in August.

Since we started on this journey of coordinating a discipleship initiative in the UIEA denomination, I get that feeling pretty regularly. Our retreat with the leadership was full of moments.\n\nYou prayed for orchestration of God moments.\n<ul>\n	<li>Afonso felt led to ask one of the leaders to plan the devotionals around the theme of forgiveness. A sharing time revealed that it touched hearts.</li>\n	<li>A group study about prayer got one group onto the topic of LISTENING and hearing God\'s voice in prayer. We didn\'t complete all the planned discussion questions, but it was worth the time spent.</li>\n	<li>I was unprepared - uncertain how to bring the chosen \"content\" for review by the group. Sitting in bed, already at the farm, just hours away from \"presenting\", the Lord brought some creative ideas together that FLOWED through the three sessions.

Tomorrow morning we head east to Menongue for the first of four follow-up visits, one to each of the regions we visited for pastors training earlier this year.  Let\'s pray similar things for these three days as for what we prayed for the leaders retreat, and see what God wants to do!

We\'ve been pastoring for many years and never had any of these things introduced to us before, so we may be slow to understand and implement what you\'re bringing. But it\'s good, and we\'ll catch on eventually.\"\r\n\r\nThis regional retreat didn\'t have blazing wow moments. In some ways we felt as though we were starting from scratch rather than making a follow up visit. But all the same, we see signs of hope that a vision for discipleship has been planted and that some seeds are starting to sprout. The pastor I quoted above is a sprout. We had good small group study and sharing times. Pray especially for the regional leadership, because they hold the water hose, metaphorically speaking. They have to power to gently irrigate, or kink the hose and let the little seedlings dry up.\r\n\r\nOnce again, we\'re reminded that we are turtles. SLOW and STEADY. Until these pastors show that they have caught on to a disciplined quiet time and have lived out small group dynamics amongst themselves, we are putting the brakes on to carry the disciple-making vision to the local church level. Each region will have its own challenges, but we sense that we need to be ready for lots of slow and steady.\r\n\r\nUnrelated to the pastors training, here\'s a story from our time in Menongue: We should know better by now, but Afonso didn\'t plan his wardrobe to include a suit and tie or closed shined shoes which are required for preaching in our churches. (In fact, many pastors have a sport coat and shined shoes ALL the time). And visitors from denominational headquarters indefinitely get asked to preach! Thankfully Afonso\'s cousin-in-law in Menongue is about the same in the shoulders and so we could borrow a suit jacket; and Afonso\'s black pants were still clean. But size 45 shoes aren\'t easy to borrow. He was threatening to preach with only black socks on his feet. . . In the new chain of shoe stores they had TWO options in his size, brown leather boots or very pointy black dress shoes, both out of our price range and not really what Afonso could wear again. We decided to try to the budget store down the street. It was past closing time but we snuck in while someone walked out the locked door. A few minutes later we walked away with \"disposable\" large size 44 shoes and a tie, all for under $10 USD. If we ever come across a large footed pastor in our travels, they will be blessed with a once-worn pair of shoes that they can probably make to last a year with good care.\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\n\r\nAfonso, Becky &amp; Yva Chinhama\r\n\r\nSIM Angola\r\n\r\nposted to chinhama.mlplace.ca\r\n\r\nwww.sim.ca','Ready, Set. . . .

We\'ve just doubled our parenting load. Yes, you heard right. When we put the word out that we were interested in adoption, we knew things could happen either fast or not at all. Well, we got to cram all the preparation and emotion of a 9 month pregnancy into a week. We got THE NEWS last Monday, met and began caring for our baby this Monday, and have arrived home with her just yesterday.\nYolisa Hope is 8 months old and an orphan. She is severely malnourished and was VERY dehydrated, weighing in at 4.5kg on Wednesday when we got her to a reliable clinic. She has already changed so much this week, is getting over her malaria, has started smiling, and is starting to bond with us!\nYolisa is Umbundu to the effect of  \"to make you joyful\" and the verse God spoke into my heart for her is Jeremiah 29:11, \"For I know the plans I have for you, declares The Lord. Plans for welfare and not calamity, to give you a future and a hope.\"\nOfficially we are foster parenting. Only after two years we can begin the legal process for adoption. We are glad that social services was thorough and required lots of duly signed and sealed background documents from her remaining family members and the community authorities where she\'s from, that should help in the future. To be honest, I think our visit by MAF\'s Cessna 182 in the small village of Cazombo will not be easily forgotten. Even in Luena, the capital of Huila province, we made quite a stir with airport officials.\nThe next few weeks we plan to be home settling us a family of four, please pray for each of us. Pray too for Yolisa to eat, sleep, gain weight, and bond.\nWe\'ll keep you posted!\nAfonso, Becky, Yva and Yolisa Chinhama\nSIM Angola\nPosted to Chinhama.mlplace.ca\nWww.sim.ca\n\nSpecial thanks to our MAF pilot/photographer, Marijn Goud, for making the trip possible and for the photos to document this momentous week!\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-372\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-2-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Yolisa 2\" width=\"604\" height=\"403\" /></a>Meeting Yolisa\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-373\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-3-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Yolisa 3\" width=\"604\" height=\"403\" /></a>In Daddy\'s capable hands\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-374\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-4-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Yolisa 4\" width=\"604\" height=\"403\" /></a>Meeting the other kids at \"Mãos Por Cazombo\" children\'s home, run by Sara Cardoso, showing next to Afonso.\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-375\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-7-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Yolisa 7\" width=\"604\" height=\"403\" /></a>Officially receiving Yolisa from her Paternal great-uncle\n\n<a href=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-376\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Yolisa-8-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Yolisa 8\" width=\"604\" height=\"403\" /></a>Officially receiving Yolisa from her Maternal great uncle','Intensive Long Term Discipleship','','publish','open','closed','','intensive-long-term-discipleship','','','2015-11-06 08:53:32','2015-11-06 15:53:32','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=377',0,'post','',0),(381,3,'2015-12-01 05:59:18','2015-12-01 12:59:18','Turtle days. (no photos, otherwise this post will NEVER get out!)\n\nI was lookng forward to writing this update from a quiet house. Afonso and Yva were out, lunch was in the oven, and Yolisa WAS asleep. Well I made an attempt with a squirmy baby on my lap, grabbing at me or my phone, depending on which direction she was facing. That was days ago...\n\nGod is answering our prayers for Yolisa! She doesn\'t look malnourished anymore, but is now 6 kg with pudgy cheeks, arms and legs, and a round belly. Her hair is growing fast and dark instead of the thin red hair we found her with. We started off power feeding her, adding therapeutic milk and/or roasted soy flour and/or spirulina powder to her food. We\'ve backed off on intensity already. And we have two teeth! Also, I\'m not a child psychologist but I don\'t think we could ask for better signs of bonding. God is good! Now if only nights were more restful... We have seen progress on this front but still aren\'t in a predictable nighttime sleep pattern.\n\nUs girls have survived our first of many stay-at-home-while-Daddy-travels stints. Afonso was away for six days, continuing where we left off with follow up visits to the regions. We were grateful that our denominational general secretary was able to make the trip to Luanda with him to \"give weight\" to the event and provide company. As usual, there were moments of encouragement and discouragement.\n\n- Some pastors were absent because their churches didn\'t have or didn\'t free up funds to pay the participant\'s fee ($40 USD equivalent).\n\n- One of the main focuses right now is for pastors to have a regular personal devotional time. The pastors present for the three days of sessions were up early each morning, but spent their time in conversation with each other. When Afonso asked who\'d had time with The Lord, only one or two raised their hands.\n\nWe are in a phase of watering a seed that\'s been planted underground, but we\'re still waiting for green shoots to push their way through to the open air. Yet we have signs of hope for a fruit bearing future:\n\n- many of the 24 participants expressed that three days was too short. This means they are gaining thirst for times of growing together!\n\n- working together in groups, the pastors were able to reproduce our denominational strategy for DiscipleMaking.\n\n- a team building game revealed some individualism in the regional leadership. We have hope that growth and change can occur now that this has been identified and visualized in a non threatening way.\n\n- locally, one pastor called up Afonso today asking to sit down together for clarification of our denominational vision and strategy. This shows that he is wrestling with it and wants to understand.\n\nTwo more follow up visits are scheduled (us girls stay home):\n<ol>\n	<li>Bié province - Chitembo - next week</li>\n	<li>Huila (home) province - 19 Dec -not a full follow up visit, but a visit to the second monthly pastors\' gathering.</li>\n</ol>\nAfonso, Becky, Yva &amp; Yolisa Chinhama\n\nSIM Angola\n\nwww.sim.ca\n\nposted to chinhama.mlplace.ca','Still Underground','','publish','open','closed','','still-underground','','','2015-12-01 05:59:18','2015-12-01 12:59:18','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=381',0,'post','',0),(384,3,'2015-12-22 14:40:17','2015-12-22 21:40:17','Ready my heart for the birth of Emmanuel; ready my heart for the Prince of Peace\r\n\r\nTurtle Tuesday 22 Dec 15\r\n\r\nSingle days have changed history time and again. And they\'ve changed you and me too! Imagine if the day of your birth had never come. What if your graduation day or wedding day or conversion day had never happened? We never know what changes a SINGLE DAY might bring, so we made the sacrifice. Afonso and our denominational General Secretary headed out on Friday the 11<sup>th</sup> in the early morning and were back by that Sunday night. They spent about 10 program hours with the pastors and lay leaders in the area of Chitembo, in Bié province. 18 hours of driving for 10 hours of program. ONE DAY. Was it worth it?\r\nAbout 5 of the 37 participants spent the same amount of time traveling to and from the event – ON FOOT. Some came from 62km away, through bush that’s almost impassable to even motorbikes. Others came 50km, others 40km.

After a group discussion about new birth, baptism, he revealed that ONE DAY, MANY years ago he was baptised, but had never really understood why, or even <img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-421\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/old-baby-300x274.jpg\" alt=\"old-baby\" width=\"300\" height=\"274\" />the message of the Gospel. He just followed the crowd. Now he feels like he “gets it” and wonders whether he should be baptised again. He is someone who personifies a picture we often show in our sessions about the necessity for discipleship in our churches. This is a reality we face daily, spiritual babies who have grown old in the church but have grown very little.\r\n\r\nOthers shared their difficulties with rebellious children, lack of shared vision in their marriages, and other family problems. It’s obvious to us lately that the enemy is working hard to destroy marriages and families. It’s a battle out there, let’s fight on our knees. It reminds us that we need to be vigilant for our own marriage and family as well.\r\n\r\nAt the end, the regional leadership expressed their gratitude for the sacrifice, and gave assurance that albeit slowly, a vision is catching on. They encouraged us to keep pressing on.\r\n\r\nAfonso also had the chance to participate in the meeting of local pastor couples. Many of the pastors were absent, but the few that participated were open and even vulnerable with one another. The pastor he met with a while back to clarify our strategy, was a catalyst for an open environment. Afonso was also able to help shape the meeting to be less leader-directed (normal) and more interactive, and he came away encouraged.\r\n\r\nWe keep taking ONE DAY at a time with our own family. November 2<sup>nd</sup>, the day we met Yolisa, was ONE DAY that turned our world on a new axis. Her growth chart has a steep cliff-like climb at the start but is leveling off into a gradual curve. Our family adaptation has followed the same curve. Looking back we can see how stressful those first days and weeks were! I think we are on the slow steady learning curve now and starting to get beyond “survival mode”. Just as with any child, there are some tough days and nights, but we are settling into our new normal. Do keep praying for Yva, she LOVES Yolisa and is always anxious for her to wake up from nights and naps, but five years of being an only child makes for a tough transition to sharing Mommy and Daddy’s attention.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve turkey dinner with other missionary friends has become a tradition for us. We are looking forward to hosting two other young families, one with visiting grandparents, and maybe one other couple this year. We will be 8-10 adults and 5 kids between 8mo and 5yrs. Christmas Day we have a church service in the morning, and then plan to spend some time with Afonso’s 3 local half-siblings and their households. Pray that it will be a meaningful ONE DAY, we don’t spend much time with them in our day-to-day lives.\r\n\r\nWe trust that you will have a BLESSED Christmas remembering ONE DAY that changed history. Emmanuel – God is WITH US.\r\n\r\nAfonso, Becky, Yva &amp; Yolisa Chinhama\r\n\r\nSIM Angola\r\n\r\nwww.sim.ca (online donations accepted)\r\n\r\nposted to chinhama.mlplace.ca (subscription options available)','One Day','','publish','open','closed','','one-day','','','2016-02-14 06:54:58','2016-02-14 06:54:58','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=384',0,'post','',0),(388,3,'2015-12-29 13:38:19','2015-12-29 20:38:19','Turtle Tuesday 29 Dec 2015\n\nWe are profoundly and humbly indebted to all of you who throughout 2015 have participated in \"our\" ministry. We don\'t have totals calculated to be able to count all of our financial or spiritual blessings, but suffice it to say....WOW. God has used YOU, and we are blessed to be turtle stepping along in this race as a result. In addition to personal and church gifts, we received two large grants for the First Ripple Discipleship project. It was a FULL year and we are FULL of thanks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven after all your generosity are you still looking for last minute year-end giving options?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy mom is planning to come to visit in mid/late January and can bring us some small items.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDid you upgrade?\n\nAfonso has a LOT of travelling ahead these next two years and is tired of lugging around his worn out laptop. He\'s interested in a used iPad that still has some life left in it (with a protective case) .\n\n&nbsp;\n\nClean water\n\nWe\'ve discovered \"Sawyer\" water filters and have been using one in our home and taking it with us on our travels. Now Afonso will be travelling on his own so we need a second one. We\'d also love to send one to Mãos por Cazombo, the children\'s home that connected us to Yolisa. They are available through Amazon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst Ripple Discipleship\n\nCommunication: every $23 USD can provide a reasonable monthly phone plan to one regional discipleship coordinator to keep connected with the pastors in his care. We have six regions plus the two of us, which comes to $187 monthly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTraining workshops\n\nOur ministry plan shows that we hope to reach 650 pastors and lay leaders with a discipleship vision, experience and training. The cost per person per event is approximately $34 USD and each pastor/leader will participate in two events, so each $68 USD can sponsor one participant. WE JUST RECEIVED WORD THAT WE HAVE A GRANT THAT COVERS 250 participants. WOW, WOW, WOW!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSupport\n\nWe continue with shortfalls in our support account with SIM Canada. Even when we get by thanks to generous and even anonymous giving, we still have little/no reserve created for our next Home Assignment (travel and housing expenses). One time gifts and monthly commitments are welcome.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGrowing family\n\nYva\'s child tax benefits came in handy to create a small reserve that allowed us to pay for our discounted MAF flight to rescue Yolisa. The total was $1726.58 USD. This is not tax deductible, but if you\'d like to help us, donations can be made to our personal account with SIM or through interac e-transfer.\n\nOnce again, THANK-YOU for being part of what God is doing in Angola. Greater things have yet to come in 2016.\n\nBlessings,\n\nAfonso, Becky, Yva &amp; Yolisa Chinhama\n\n------\n\nposted to chinhama.mlplace.ca\n\nHOW TO DONATE to SIM\n\nwww.sim.ca or www.sim.org, find donate button, or mailing address\n\nProject donations: project # AO 94297\n\nSupport and personal donations: missionary # 064203\n\nItems to send with Mom: call her at <a href=\"tel:+1%20(780)%20963-6561\">+1 (780) 963-6561</a> to arrange, or deliver to:\n\nBetty Loewen\n\nRR2, Site 9, Comp 17\n\n<a href=\"//embedded-result/2468\">Stony Plain, AB.  T7Z 1X2</a>','Year End Giving','','publish','open','closed','','year-end-giving','','','2015-12-29 13:38:19','2015-12-29 20:38:19','',0,'http://wp-mlplace.rhcloud.com/aby/?p=388',0,'post','',0),(394,3,'2016-01-21 13:33:38','2016-01-21 20:33:38','','IMG_3877','','inherit','open','closed','','img_3877','','','2016-01-21 13:33:38','2016-01-21 20:33:38','',395,'http://chinhama/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3877.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(395,3,'2016-01-23 03:11:31','2016-01-23 10:11:31','<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-397 size-large\" src=\"http://chin.mlplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3924-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_3924\" width=\"840\" height=\"630\" />\r\n\r\nThis grinning girl is still small for her age, but at least she\'s ON the growth chart now! Most importantly, her weight for height ratio is now nearing average. In the almost three months she\'s been with us, she\'s gained 3kg and 6cm. She is in a hurry to reach as many milestones as she can in as short a time as possible. Big ones like crawling, pulling up on the furniture, clapping her hands and waving bye-bye are now ticked off! The most fun for us these past few days is how she is starting to finish a little song we sing for her, \"Três palavrinhas só, Eu aprendi de cor; Deus é Amor; la la la la la la la la la\". (She does the la-la-la bit). <em>Three little words I learned by heart: God is Love.</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs of yet, we have no official foster parent documents for Yolisa. Please pray that the documents we are waiting for will be signed by mid-week next week so that we have more security crossing a provincial border with her next weekend. AND so that we can move forward with other steps like passports and visas because we REALLY want to make it to my sister’s wedding on May 14<sup>th</sup>!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBig sister Yva has spent the past two weeks doing some kindergarten at the little Mitcha International School as a transition to her official school career. She has her uniform and is ready to begin \"Pré\" at the local Christian School the first week of February. We will supplement with some homeschooling in English. Yva is very aware of words and is starting to sound out signs and labels. It\'s fun when she discovers that she is able to read! Her proud moment this morning was spelling my Mom’s name “Bedi” (Betty) and our city “Lobgo” (Lubango) all by herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJanuary has been a NO-TRAVEL month so far! Well, no overnight travel anyway. We plan to travel only the last weekend of the month for a SIM team retreat at the coast.  Afonso\'s travel schedule for the year will still need to be firmed up because some of the projected dates of travel inside Angola conflict with dates of international travel. International travel is first on the list - back to Ethiopia, this time for the inaugural meeting of the Africa Strategic Discipleship Movement. On the heels of that we expect to lead our first quarterly discipleship retreat for the UIEA leadership. And from there. . . .Afonso will make two rounds of the 6 UIEA regions to train pastors and lay leaders. The goal: to train 650 pastors and lay leaders, so that by the end of this year they have the vision and necessary experience and tools to begin leading a small group of 10. That means that 6,500 church members could be provided with an environment for growth by the end of the year. May it be so!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAn unexpected opportunity came up a few weeks back. Good friends of ours are the Angolan directors for Youth for Christ. The speaker for their annual youth camp cancelled 2-3 days before camp was to begin, so they called us to see if we could help. Between the two of us we spoke 5 times on the theme of “For FROM Him and TO Him and THROUGH Him are all things.” Each morning our still-new ministry vehicle descended the newly widened and paved, winding, switchback road to Bibala. The campers studied and discussed the same themes in other forums throughout the week. Please pray that our words, along with the whole camp experience, will be catalysts for a deeper walk with Christ.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese days we are also doing some pre-marriage counselling, also a last minute request. One of Afonso’s cousins is beginning married life, but has heard from too many friends, “It would have been better if I hadn’t gotten married.” So he asked for our help to lay some foundations for a healthy relationship in hopes that they can avoid some pitfalls. Pre-marriage counselling is usually done by the pastor who celebrates a wedding. This means that usually only people who meet the requirements for a church wedding get the chance for counselling. This couple has already conceived a child together, and the girl is not a church member, so they don’t qualify. We are proud that this cousin is looking for Biblical counsel and honored that he came to us. Pray for wisdom for us, for open, honest dialogue for the couple, and that we’ll be able to clearly present the Gospel in our times together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe have come to the conclusion that we must enjoy being tired! Last week we turned our house upside down in order to get our bathroom lights re-wired and then repainted half the interior of our home. Each night we fell into bed exhausted but it sure is nice to finally have no more visible smoke damage from our December 2014 grease fire. Oh dear, we still haven’t done the pantry…\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nO me of little faith! I was going to send out this update yesterday, telling you that my Mom’s visit had to be postponed because she hadn’t received her entry visa for Angola. But, her visa was granted at the last possible minute and . . . . well. . . keep praying! Her passport is due at the Purolator depot in Edmonton at 10am on Saturday morning, and her first flight leaves at 12:45. If she doesn’t make it, Dad will drive her to Calgary in hopes to catch up with her flight to Frankfurt. According to the online road report I found, it looks like the QE2 highway is clear and dry! Lord Willing, she’ll arrive here Monday evening our time. Pray especially for her layover in Luanda. We have family there to help, but Luanda is what it is – a chaotic African megacity!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThanks for your prayers!

Yolisa started coughing on Saturday. On Monday we saw a doctor but everything pointed to a simple virus. Tuesday night she took a turn for the worse, started a fever, got lethargic, and lost her appetite. So yesterday morning we brought her up to the hospital. We were admitted as soon as her oxygen saturation was measured. Praise God, Yolisa is responding well to the oxygen, IV fluids and various medications she\'s on, and slept with no fever and much less coughing.  She\'s conversing with me this morning. Her malaria test came back positive, and we\'ll learn more this morning whether her diagnosis includes pneumonia or something else. She still doesn\'t want to take anything in her mouth, not even water, so please pray that she\'ll get her appetite back soon. Find our hospital online at www.ceml.org.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMom arrived Monday night, just in time for all this excitement.
